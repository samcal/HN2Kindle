You don't have to be local
2012-12-02
You can focus your time locally or globally.
But if you over-commit yourself locally, you under-commit yourself globally, and vice-versa.
If you’re local, then you’re probably social, doing a lot of things in-person, and being a part of your community.  But this means you’ll have less time to focus on creating things for the world.
If you’re global, then you want to focus on creating things that can reach out through distribution to the whole world.  But this means you’ll have less time to be part of your local community.
Neither is right or wrong, but you need to be aware of the choices you’re making.
For me, the reason I’m writing this, is a personal announcement that I’ve tried both ways, felt the difference, and made my choice.
Some background:
I lived in Woodstock, New York for 3 years. While in my little house in the woods, I started CD Baby and Hostbaby, and connected with thousands of people.  Only after I left, when someone asked me what I thought of the people there, did I realize that I never met anyone in Woodstock.  I just lived there, but didn’t socialize there.  All my attention was focused out to the world, and it was very effective.
Then I lived in Portland, Oregon for 3 years.  I worked every waking hour, growing CD Baby and Hostbaby.  It was incredibly productive.  I made some dear and deep friends worldwide, but none in Portland.  I never hung out in Portland.  My attention was still focused outward.
Then two years ago, when I moved to Singapore, I decided to do the opposite.  I wanted to get to know my local community.  I met with over 400 people, one-on-one, went to every conference and get-together, and said yes to every request.  I spent most of the last two years just talking with people.  And I really got to know the Singapore community.
But something never felt right.  After a day of talking, I was often exhausted and unfulfilled.  Two hours spent being useful to one person who wants to “pick my brain” is two hours I’d rather spend making something that could be useful to the whole world (including that one person).
Then people around the world email to ask why I’ve been so silent.  No new articles.  No progress on my companies.  Nothing.
So there’s the trade-off.  By being so local-focused, I’m not being as useful as I was when I was making things online.
So I’m finally admitting : I’m not local.
I moved around so much that I’m not from anywhere.  I feel equally connected to London, Los Angeles, New York, New Zealand, Singapore, San Francisco, Iceland, and India.  I care about people in all of those places.  They’re all equally home.  Just because I live in one now, doesn’t mean I should ignore the others.
To me, the emphasis on local stuff never felt right.  When I was in Woodstock and Portland, people would ask what I was doing to promote the local music scene there.  I’d argue that I shouldn’t favor Woodstock or Portland any more than Wellington or Prague.
But that’s just me.
Some people feel a strong separation between inside and outside.  If you’re a part of their family, neighborhood, church, school, or a friend-of-a-friend, then you’re an insider.  Everyone else is an outsider.  They say, “The reason you go to university is for the connections you’ll have for life.”  In business, they give preferential treatment to their inside circle.  (This is cronyism.)
Other people feel no separation.  You’re treated equally, no matter where you’re from or who you know.  There are no outsiders.  If extra-strong bonds are made, it’s based on who you are now - not where you came from or where you’ve been.
One will feel more natural to you.  Like your tendency to be an introvert vs extrovert, or conservative vs liberal, these base world-views will shape your preferences for being local-focused or global-focused.
Each industry has their own version of this decision.
If you want to make vegetarian food, you can make a great vegetarian restaurant, or a distributed line of vegetarian meals.
If you’re a musician, you can do 100 gigs or write and record 100 songs.
Etc.  Different focus.  Different approach.
Both are necessary. Neither is right or wrong, but you need to be aware of the choices you’re making.
For me, for now, I’m going to stop doing in-person meetings, and turn my attention fully to writing, programming, and recording things that can benefit anyone anywhere.

Denny (2012-12-02) #Well said Derek, I when through the same exercise in a different context, first started working in a large multinational (working global) then moved to local (working in SME). Welcome back to global.  Best, Denny
Mark Vidales (2012-12-02) #Good points, when my kids move out, hopefully within 4 years we would love to be a perpetual traveler and live in different countries. Is that one of your houses  in the picture?
I don't own any houses (or apartments), and I'm definitely a fan of the permanent-traveler lifestyle.  (The photo is just a house in Iceland, taken from Flickr. Represented solitude, to me. Plus Iceland has my heart.) -- Derek
Chris Picton (2012-12-02) #That's great to hear as I've missed reading your posts etc and was wondering what had happened. I hope you are working on new ideas and look forward to hearing about them in the not too distant future.
Cheers,
Chris (UK)
Kristie (2012-12-02) #Always love what you have to say. Since I live in Idaho I'm happy that your going global
Sriram Thaiyar (2012-12-02) #&amp;quot;...can benefit anyone anywhere ANYTIME&amp;quot;
thanks for coming back!
Ksenia Jdanova (2012-12-02) #Derek, i totally agree with you! What a nice idea. I guess every person can change the point of view.  The most important thing - is to feel what you really need to do at this certain moment and just do it, BUT  also its important to tell about ur own decission to other people, who is connected with you  To be open about any ur decission - thats the key. Thank you, Derek!
charlie (2012-12-02) #thanks very much for the perspective
Adam O (2012-12-02) #I was having a very similar internal dialog about this 15 minutes ago. I now have some more clarity thanks to your post. Coincidental timing or something else. Thank you!
Jerry (2012-12-02) #Thanks for this. Perhaps this is why in my own experience I have never really felt like I belong anywhere...and yet admittedly I have been too afraid to move away. Now I'm kind of stuck...not trapped...just stuck (bills, house, etc.) and opportunities are scarce at best. It's very frustrating...but I think I see now that I'm much more focused (at least on the idea) of being global rather than local.
Steve Valerio (2012-12-02) #Just want to thank you Derek for your logic, your clarity of thought, and your generosity in sharing.
Peter Tanham (2012-12-02) #He's back! Hooray!
Mika Pohjola (2012-12-02) #Well said, as always. I feel like this &amp;quot;global thinking&amp;quot; is benefitting me, too, being now based in Stockholm as opposed to New York City.
Will Kriski (2012-12-02) #People often romanticize traveling to remote locations. Most times it's because they think something 'out there' will make them happy. Some future moment will be better than the present moment.
I'm at home 99% of the time but I occasionally enjoy bumping into a neighbour and I don't connect to the local community for the most part. I could live anywhere it doesn't really matter as I do programming from home. I help my local wildlife sanctuary but at the same time have helped people online with guitar lessons on YouTube and open source speech apps for those with speech impairments. It's all good to me.
Sounds like you have a nice balance.   -- Derek
Mike Rubini (2012-12-02) #Thanks.
Bel Stuart (2012-12-02) #Hey Derek- I just recently had a similar epiphany. Home for me is a state of mind and it has more to do with my overall connections to people and discovering new things than a tangible place. I've been both globally and locally focused and for me I have accepted that I prefer the latter. I've got ties to Nashville, Seattle, Austin, Chicago, London, NYC and Berlin but where I live is just that. It's not who I am or what I want to offer the rest of the world. Thanks for this article and for all your inspiration over the years. It really hit the spot and at a perfect time.
Steve wyman (2012-12-02) #Hi
I know how you feel. I live on the web and very aware of what's happening in (my online) world but don't have a clue what's happening in my local town...
Being selfish, having you work and share on line more again will be great, the audience and ability to influence is so much greater online
Looking forward to reading more of your insights
Lang Elliott (2012-12-02) #Of course, there is always the concept of &amp;quot;balance.&amp;quot; Achieving a healthy balance between local and global is maybe not so difficult to pull off?
Yes! Great point. I feel all-or-nothing about it because it simplifies the many local requests. It's a matter of focus.  Maybe others can focus some-local some-global, but for me I feel more productive and more peace-of-mind when my home is just home, and my business/creative efforts are focused to the whole world equally. -- Derek
Bruno Pinaud (2012-12-02) #Make this choice after Brasil.
  We'll get there.... We think of you, Flavia, and Alê often. -- Derek
Razvan Rogoz (2012-12-02) #Interesting article.
It reminds me of one important fact. When I feel lonely (as in need of being social), I am social. But I spend so much time and energy and at the end of the day I get nothing done. I feel like I've improved someone's else life but I haven't improved my own a bit.
On the other hand, when I feel balanced, I can simply focus on the big picture and not take a great interest in every problem, person, opportunity around me.
Greg Haas (2012-12-02) #Very thought provoking post.
I think about my local community (and how I do and do not &amp;quot;fit in&amp;quot;, by choice and not). But more than that, I was inspired to reflect on how others come and go from this local community and try to give but never seem to get back something as fulfilling as they'd like. I don't want to oversimplify but it is as though they give and give locally, but the local community can't or won't give back to them in some way that seems equitable. Eventually they appear to burn out then distance themselves.
In so many way, what I'm thinking now is that relationships with those in a local community can be a different kind of messy than with a global/online community. Do we run into more direct, one-on-one real interactions with others not equal to us (better *or* worse) when we interact locally? Yes? No? How is putting something out there for others in a global community a different thing that putting something out there locally?
I'm also thinking about cronyism and an idea I've recently seen pop up again about making online communities exclusive. That success will come mo' quicka if we limit who's allowed in the door.
Is this local/global thing related to big fish/small pond ideas somehow?
Derek, thank you, again, for your writings. I don't, in my local community, find interactions that are as thought provoking. I can only hear so much talk about football and hunting before I have to reach out to a larger, and in this case, online community.
Devin Lyttle (2012-12-02) #Once again, thanks for taking the time to put my thoughts into words. I've been so focused on &amp;quot;changing the world&amp;quot; that I've totally neglected my local surroundings and the people in my life. Being an introvert, this is only natural; although after years of this I'm beginning to feel the lack of interpersonal relationships may be affecting my wellbeing.
I truly believe that we're all intrinsically connected and, to some degree, feed off the energy of others. Granted, if it's not natural for you to be socially engaged, then over time you'll find your energy depleted. Ultimately, as with everything, I think it's essential to find a balance between the two worlds: help your neighbors but not at the expense of bettering the global community.
I do look forward to seeing you progress your efforts on MuckWork. I've seen several products pop up recently that are similar (although not specifically music-based), but have always felt that your concept would tie in nicely with the framework we're creating.
Great photo, btw. Makes me miss Iceland.
Jo Young (2012-12-02) #Very interesting. I had come to a similar conclusion in that I find people falling into two categories, inclusive or exclusive. I like your link with worldview. I think it is a continuum when it comes to local and global and a mix certainly suits me best. I think it's possible to act with a global mindset in the local situation and it does not have to be an either/or but an and/and situation. Always find your posts food for thought Derek.
beatriz (2012-12-02) #I strongly identify myself with your perspective, however, sometimes we can't choose, even if we know what we are and want to.
We can be endogenous global but, if we work and live in a community we must invest time and effort in that community if we do not want to subject ourselves to live by the standards of others, sometimes against's our owns.
What goes on in our 'petit' environment affect us directly.
Seth W. (2012-12-02) #Wow, I thought I was the only one who was exhausted after a few hours meeting with someone. That is was a &amp;quot;personal failing.&amp;quot; Glad to hear it's not just me.
Heidi Ohlander (2012-12-02) #Welcome back to the global focus! I too have been focused locally for the past year due to various circumstances.
I have been feeling the call to be global again. I gave local a good solid try, but its just not me.
Twitter and Instagram have been my way to bridge both local and global in the past year.
I am very excited to see where the next few months take you! (If you could see me locally I am smiling enthusiastically for you!)
Jody Whitesides (2012-12-02) #Currently thinking local and going global.
As for Iceland... The world could do itself a major favor by following it's example in fixing it's recent woes. Especially the U.S. and Europe whom are going about it totally backwards.

Jiri Novotny (2012-12-02) #You could also look at this as two cycles - local and global. Both are important. I think that even if you have strong preference for one or the other, you will still switch to the different cycle now and then.
Similarly, there is time for expansion, and time for introversion and consolidation.
  Very well-put. -- Derek
Seth Bender (2012-12-02) #Hi Derek,
I really enjoyed this article and found it insightful, particularly because sometimes I don't really think about what I am doing in terms of marketing nor focusing on the effect that my marketing will have in the long run.  I like the fact that you don't recommend a particular path (local or global) but allow the readers to draw the conclusions that best fit their own interests and personalities.  Well done, man.
Lang Elliott (2012-12-02) #With regard to the concept of balance, I am comfortable with having a global emphasis in my work while making sure I do not neglect local friendships and other direct and intimate connections in my localized sensory bubble.
The goal, I guess, is to feel comfortable being here and now as an embodied person in my local landscape, while at the same time spending countless hours working in front of a computer or out in nature (in my case) with an eye toward a larger, more global effect.
martin kenny (2012-12-02) #Derek, Im glad you're back , lending positive vibes to this unpositive world, and thank you for caring, I just wish one out of a million would care as much , Peace , Martin
Dan McReavy (2012-12-02) #I disagree that you have to pick and choose between local and global.  At nwzPaper, we've built the platform to scale content around the world from the local market up to the national and THEN the global market.

Aaron Kulbe (2012-12-02) #If Iceland has your heart, why not live there, instead of Singapore?
One of the things I couldn't help big wonder, when I read this post, was if this meant your time in Singapore was soon coming to a close...
Cheers,
Aaron K.
We'll see.   -- Derek
Donald (2012-12-02) #I think that this is probably one of the best and most insightful pieces that you have written Derek, thanks for posting.
Dean Shull (2012-12-02) #Your insights are always aligned with my ponderings.  Great to be able to hear your kind and wise global voice once again and hopefully more often.
Janet Lanier (2012-12-02) #Your article really eased a concern I had. I had worked locally as a musician in Texas but when my husband got a job in Colorado a few years ago, I decided to focus my efforts towards composition/arranging and was fortunate enough to work with people online around the world. However, I was feeling guilty not participating in the local music programs but when I did, I too felt very drained and thought I could accomplish so much more at home at the computer coming up with music ideas. I still do some performing locally but I'm very selective now.  Derek, you have eased my concerns and given me a better perspective. Thanks!
Jeff McLeod (2012-12-02) #Glad to see you'll be writing more!  I use a similar approach at work.   I try to balance working on items that are very inward focused and more 1:1 with my direct team, with doing things that are outward in nature and help the greater company or group.   I find when I focus in one araea more than the other I'm not as fufuilled as when they are in balance.  It's tough to keep the balance, and there will be times when you have to spent more time in one than the other.   The main thing is being aware and adjusting when needed.
John Bowden (2012-12-02) #Hello Derek:
What you said brings to mind what globalists are trying to do by just the opposite! On all counts your main message screams out &amp;quot;communication is important local and globally&amp;quot; of  which I agree wholeheartedly. Globalists (the elite) would rather we &amp;quot;not&amp;quot; build bonds with people, friends, services, etc.. but rather we depend on government for &amp;quot;everything&amp;quot;. A complete socialist society for the &amp;quot;world&amp;quot;. 40 years ago you wouldn't even be having this conversation or at least no where's near intense. Globalism is coming to fruition and that is not a good thing. I would like to put all the pieces together from what you said here in your statements. We need a system not run by the government ie:, Facebook. Similar in structure but with more &amp;quot;defined&amp;quot; portals whereas one has the option to expand or contract but the option should be there for everyone. So anyone who wants to increase their range of communications within a particular genre, can! Plain and simple. ;)
Michael Monagan (2012-12-02) #Fascinating article. It however brought up a discussion I was having with a friend who works at a music prep office who said that many young people today, although perfectly capable of doing the work at hand, can't get along with their co-workers. He's seen many of them come and go simply for that reason. I use social media all the time but it has changed the way that people interact and I'm afraid that the combination of smaller families (many only children), &amp;quot;everyone's a winner&amp;quot; attitude, and social media (if you don't agree with the person you just block them) has resulted in young people who can't work in a collaborative situation. This does not bode well for the future.
Riley (2012-12-02) #Glad to hear your coming back to the rest of the world!
brian piercy (2012-12-02) #Man, this rings so true.
I've lived in Austin for 20 years but have *way* more friends in West Virginia (where I grew up) and globally (thanks to my tech interests). In-person convos usually involve my co-workers, a neighbor or two, and the occasional startup geek in town.
Networking events? They feel SO forced. Invitations for coffee? Usually accepted out of curiosity, but they are really hit-or-miss. This is heightened by having to live in the suburbs instead of downtown.
My parents used to ask why I didn't involve myself in &amp;quot;the community&amp;quot;. I think it's because I consider the globe my community. Roaming is a way good thing.
Joan Martin (2012-12-02) #TCK's are defined as Third Country Kids. I identify with this. I am born American but do not have the inner feeling of &amp;quot;home&amp;quot;. However, I live in the Bay Area in a home. Having lived in and travelled to many other places in the world, I feel &amp;quot;at home&amp;quot; in many places and with many people.
When posed with the question, &amp;quot;Where are you from?&amp;quot;, I never know what to say. Where was I born? Where is most of my stuff? Where is my partner? my cat? Otherwise I always want to say, &amp;quot;I am from everywhere.&amp;quot;
I feel connected to much outside of my neighborhood and most of my work is to benefit others but once in a while I participate locally when requested because it is good to get out of my head and into where my feet are. Example: I served on the neighborhood Board for 2 years where I now understand the local issues and concerns forever - a great opportunity to learn and give back.
But sometimes I just have to be &amp;quot;be a happy idiot and struggle for the legal tender.&amp;quot;  (Jackson Browne)
Rob Roper (2012-12-02) #I think extremes in this case are bad.  You went from one extreme (Woodstock, Portland) to the other (Singapore).  Sounds like you're now going back to the Woodstock/Portland extreme, if I'm reading you correctly.
I suggest avoiding the all-or-nothing extremes.  If your preference now is global, that's ok, but don't make it 100% and completely shut out your neighbors and other local folks.  Maybe you could shoot for 80%-20%?
I live on a corner, and there is someone living catty-corner from me, and I've never seen them.  I see pizza delivery boys bringing pizza from a crappy chain.  There's a local neighborhood restaurant 100 yards away that makes great pizza.  I think to myself, what a shame.

Bill MacKechnie (2012-12-02) #Of all the articles of yours I've read, this one hit nearest to home for me. I have never felt &amp;quot;local&amp;quot; in my life, and still have problems trying to explain my choices (musical and otherwise) to people in my life, who have found their comfortable niche in their communities.
Many thanks for sharing this and here's hoping those who judge folks like us as &amp;quot;self absorbed and snobbish&amp;quot; might now have a bit more of an understanding of our focus.
Jon England (2012-12-02) #The benefits of both (local and global) can be had - I feel - as long as one crystalizes two things in the mind;
1) Keep up local contacts/connections who/which are rich in value - culturally, personally, co-operatively, but acknowledge that geography is at best a happenstance eventuality.  Human interaction keeps one humble and brain-trained for the pursuit of living
2) Consider the world your village; research, maintain and optimize all the pathways and exclude no-one, based on geography, from the output of your creativity.
Easier said than done, but consistently practiced yields the optimum value for all....no?
Robert G. Ferrell (2012-12-02) #It would seem to me that the intersection of these two somewhat disparate social subsets would be to involve people in your local community in a project with global consequences. This would likely have several salutary aspects: one, it would expand the social and geopolitical horizons of the participants; two, it bring the local community onto the world stage, as it were; and three, it would not require you as the instigator to make an absolute choice between local and globally affiliations.
This premise is nothing new, of course. Many organizations dedicated to humanitarian and environmental causes already operate under this general structural umbrella. But in the context of local vs. global actions I think it bears reiteration.
Wouter (2012-12-02) #Hi Derek,
Interesting article, thank you for sharing! Never thought about things in this perspective. Is the choice you define here only a recent one to make, since the upcoming of the internet? To be global in the way you desribe has something virtual for me - for instance, I'd certainly miss the interaction with an audience during a concert. Recordings for me don't capture the 'magic' that can happen live.
For me the choice is not A or B. I'd go for both and invent a time dimension with 36 hours in a day.
For me, it was pre-internet. I've been moving around since 1987. My best friends have always been people I met in-person, while visiting or living somewhere, but then keep in touch with by phone and occasional visits, afterwards. -- Derek
Lang Elliott (2012-12-02) #On further thought, I think there are four categories:
local - personal (eg. home life, friendships, one-on-one talks)
local - impersonal (eg. publications, talks to big audiences, etc.)
global - personal (eg. us commenting here and now)
global - impersonal (eg. create a great product and be done with it)
: &amp;gt;) Thanks Derek! It's fun thinkin' about this stuff!
NICE! LOVE IT!   -- Derek

Matt (2012-12-02) #As someone who has chosen local by trying to open a coffee shop in my town, I have to disagree with your characterization of locals only as people who seek out closed societies. Think of any small shop where you received excellent, personable service on your first visit - those people draw energy from treating people (any person) well, meeting them face to face and then sending them back into the world. Check out the book &amp;quot;The Blue Bottle Craft of Coffee&amp;quot; to see it in action. But I think you're generally right these are distinct focuses of people's work.
Tim Porcelli (2012-12-02) #Greetings Derek,
Good post...Thanks!
I like Jiri's comment about the cycles.
Cyclical awareness has served me well. When I become aware that a cycle is ending, I remind myself to listen and look for the cues of the next cycle.
There is a constant flux and shift between my musical projects and my daily clinical work. The cues tend to be pretty clear, even when I'm not quite ready for the shifts. The initial cues usually manifest as a decline in interest in the current activities, often accompanied by restlessness.
The musical cycles have moved back and forth  from improvisational to composition-oriented. Alternating the focus between these two approaches tends to refresh my attitude and energy for both.
I expect that we all live by cycles. I think that one of the obstacles to organically changing with the cycles is the fear of leaving something behind. I suppose it may be different for each of us.
Best wishes with your future endeavors!
Tim
Marla McDaniels Heath (2012-12-02) #Your thoughts are timely.  We need to find a balance between the two; local or global.  Both are necessities.  Thanks for the insight and keeping in touch!

Laura Rendahl (2012-12-02) #Your accomplishments while following your passion have helped so many other artists.  You need to do what feels best for you as your life evolves.  So many artists including myself are truly facing difficult times right here at home....are stuck and just not sure how to stay afloat and turn it around.  I agree with making the best use of your capabilities on a larger scale..while also remembering that you started by helping one or two friends and yourself and it snowballed.  While I love the Heifer International concept of helping others help themselves, I also believe there is such a need right here in this country that has been overlooked...adopting outside the country and donating to other countries before addressing issues at home has created the current state of our nation.
Clare Hedin (2012-12-02) #I really appreciate reading this article - thank you Derek.
I come from UK but have travelled most of my life and am now a joint citizen of CA (USA!) and UK
I left my original local community because I had a natural impulse to 'reach out' and extend into other lives, other communities and, although I really enjoy one on one time, I still find myself 'hopping' between places, like a pollinating bee. My original family and friends found it disconcerting and I couldn't really explain it to them, then.
Professionally and socially I sometimes worry about being 'left behind' -  it can be tempting to me to want to 'dig in' sometimes for that reason.  I sometimes worry that I'll never create a singular strong, reliable community that will accept me fully as a result of my more temporary nature. However, I know people in many different places, and I do seem blessed to have a knack for making new friends and finding the right resources quickly, for which I'm very thankful.  And people do open their doors to wandering spirits
I basically feel more alive and more creative when I know I am 'free to roam' and respond to the inner urges to mix it up a bit and put myself in new situations.
I couldn't do it without my intuition, my curiosity or my sense of drive.
And thanks for all the other curious people - who do stay put - and who want to meet those of us who have to keep moving to breathe, to think, to create and, ultimately, to contribute. (at least that's what I care about, as well as feeling alive!)
Thanks again, Derek, I'm one more step to feeling that my choices are 'ok'! lol

Mark Gilman (2012-12-02) #Thanks for having the guts to make that statement.  That's exactly how I feel, but always felt guilty that I wasn't more involved locally.  You can get in a real rut trying to stay local especially in a very small community like Santa Barbara where I live.  After awhile, you've done it all and there's nothing left but to go global.  Well put thoughts.
Pete Dulin (2012-12-02) #Hi Derek,
This thought-provoking post prompts me to think about which prism I want to use to view both what I want to accomplish and the people I want my accomplishments to touch.
By turning the prism this way or that, I can shift from local to globa, or vice versa, and choose to dedicate my time, energy, and resources either way. While not mutually exclusive, it makes sense that a person can be most effective if a person understands their innate nature and who they want to reach.
I have focused on &amp;quot;local&amp;quot; for the better part of the past decade as a writer, editor and publisher. Local has been my turf, be it publishing a local online magazine or releasing my first local-focused cookbook or simply supporting like-minded creative and entrepreneurial souls in my community.
With my first book under my belt, I am mulling over ideas for the next book, what the subject matter will entail, and who I want to reach with my writing. Thinking local or global is an important consideration.
Thanks for helping me to reflect and, eventually, crystallize my intentions into action.
Evzen Holas (2012-12-02) #Why does it have to be so extreme, either - or? You can be fairly easily both, local and worldly. You remind me of some of those AA people. They either drink like idiots or not at all. Which is sad, because alcohol is great if you don't have to go over the limits every day.  Evzen
Dmitry Tikov (2012-12-02) #Welcome home, to Globalistan!
Bruce Peters (2012-12-02) #Very thought provoking post for me. Have not read all the comments so hope this
is not too repetitive. This leads to a couple of  questions for me:
1.  What serves me and my cause better? ( Local vs Global)
2. How could I utilize one the other or both most effectively?
Running in the background is the last line or two of a poem by, perhaps,  Oriah Mountain Dreamer. &amp;quot;Can you (I) be alone or with others and truly love the company
that I keep&amp;quot;. Both Local and Global.
Stacey (2012-12-02) #excellent observation!  I will probably spend a good deal of time reflecting on your thoughts.
I love to travel and perform because I feel like I am seeing the places I go from the &amp;quot;backside&amp;quot; so to speak.  Meeting people who are working behind the scenes and working along-side them to create an event is much more rewarding than actually going to the event as a guest or participant for me.
I'm sort of introverted with an extroverted twist and performing on stage gives me a place to feel confortable and involved.  then I go home and hole up with my other interests...
Thanks again for sharing with the global community - you are insightful and gifted in relaying you vision.
Rob (2012-12-02) #I'm so with you Derek!  Glad you're helping other generate their own awareness on this.  You're always big picture man!  Nice piece. - RR
Eva Beneke (2012-12-02) #Reading this, I felt relieve. I thought something was wrong with me, moving every 4 to 5 years and never ready to settle. Thanks for your sharing, Derek.
As an introvert with a love for the stage, being global is the best thing for me, too. I have never felt comfortable in &amp;quot;cliques&amp;quot; of people, yet I cultivate deep friendships and connections all over the world. The beautiful thing about making a choice is that it helps us define who we are - right NOW.
Nina Gomes (2012-12-02) #Bravo for you, Derek! Wishing you great joy in this new awareness of yourself. Thank  you for sharing your &amp;quot;enlightenment&amp;quot;. As  Marianne Williams states: &amp;quot;... And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same...... &amp;quot;  Finding our own balance is the greatest gift we can give ourselves and... those around us..... Cheers!
PS.. would love to hear any of your new works... Keep us informed.... As a former producer, I am always appreciative  and excited by new works.... Blessings.
William P. Robertson (2012-12-02) #I've had great success at the local/regional level as a writer by being very social.  In October I had over 60,000 hits on my website, too.  That didn't translate into many book sales, though.  My question is how do you get to the global level if you have books that do very well locally?
Lenora Melville (2012-12-02) #For the first time in history anyone can be global. Anyone with access to the internet can connect to someone or something somewhere instead of just in their small local scene. Finding the who what and where that makes us feel at home is key. Thank you for sharing your thoughts.
Seth Godin (2012-12-02) #welcome back, Derek.
We miss you. We needed you.
  Thanks Seth! -- Derek
Tommy (2012-12-02) #Thanks for the reminder.I have this conversation weekly with people who don't understand.I have lived in so many places and find them ,for the most part,cold and sterile.The small moments of success on a local level never compare to sharing with the world and having the world share right back with you.The amount of energy used to establish yourself locally is equal to establish yourself globally,though it may take longer.The key word I hear lately is persistence ,there are already plenty of talented failures out there,don't give up !!!!!
Dorothy Potter (2012-12-02) #Interesting post. Re what you said about recording 100 songs or doing 100 gigs, yes, I agree that you cannot do both. Problem with that in the music scene today is that unless you ARE doing those 100 gigs, you can't sell the 100 songs! Hence the poverty of so many musicians. The whole model of being the publicist, producer, marketing department, art department, tour planner, and composer/lyricist is just too much for anyone, and all of that office stuff eventually saps any spirit you ever had to create and make art. I don't know that anyone has ever really solved this. I solved it by giving up trying to make a living at music. I did it for a bunch of years, and now I am a translate and language coach working over the internet with folks all over the world. It's a much better living and when I make music, I do it for fun.
I think that CD Baby was a wonderful thing and worked really well for a few really driven people. But if music is going to be more than a hobby for more than the privileged few in this country, there needs to be a change in how these enormous media monopolies handle music &amp;quot;product&amp;quot; and artists.
Best wishes,
Dorothy P Snyder
Jeanette Arsenault (2012-12-02) #Welcome back, Derek - we've missed you! Very very very very good observation &amp;amp; thought-provoking/internalizing issue- do what works for you. We need both kinds &amp;amp; sometimes a balance of the two as best we can. Good message
Andrey Filatov (2012-12-02) #Welcome back! Looking forward to hear on your new projects!
Rodrigo Sigal (2012-12-02) #As always Derek it is great to read you. Why not combining both things? It seem to me that you either choose one or the other. Is it true with you like it is for me, that one can't switch easily from global- to loca-mode easily? Even tougher when you have kids like me! Anyway, I have had a disappointment with the new cdbaby policies recently that made me think that even amazing projects like cdbaby change an one must adapt and find new paths.
Enjoy the next phase and consider Mexico in your plans as I said before!
Gabi (2012-12-02) #From your list of countries you lived in, I see that none of them was a country where English was not among the official languages. See, I am German by birth and upbringing, I live in the Netherlands, I am married to an American, and I work in an international organization. I speak English most of the time at work, at home, and with close friends, Dutch only when in public - at the market, in the supermarket, or at local events and gatherings - and German very rarely these days, just when I visit or get together with other Germans. My social media streams are 98% in English, because I have many international friends all over the world. I am global - both in terms of content as well as in terms of target groups. But that also means that part of the Dutch community will never perceive me as one of them. They tweet in Dutch, they blog in Dutch, they update their Facebook and G+ status in Dutch, and generally they prefer following Dutch social media streams as well, even though they all excel in English. I was actually thinking of starting a Dutch blog on the side, just because. But then again, I don't want to let things get out of hand. I spend way too much time on social media already as it is. So, I'll just stick with English and global, and will be happy with those who follow anyway, even though English isn't their native language.
Rob Daly (2012-12-02) #'Local' does not have to mean you need to go to every meeting and say 'yes' to every request.  I know you know this already, but maintaining focus on what you believe in and are passionate about is critical, and then monitoriing yourself when you are straying outside your area of value (like I am now ).  Either way, you provide great stuff as always, and I think your next step sounds solid.
Derrik Jordan (2012-12-02) #Thanks Derek - glad to have you back with the world!
In the old days if you wanted to be global you had to get on a ship and sail for a few weeks to another shore, then apply your local skills there. Very cumbersome but people like Ben Franklin did just that. He clearly needed a more global market for his ideas. If you wanted to hear music in those days you had to 1) make it yourself 2) go where it was being made or 3) be rich enough to hire your own musicians. Music was a lot more rare than it is today where we can just flip a switch and have any style in our ears.
it's a different world that we live in which means we have a very different set of choices. It is about choice and balance and everyone needs to check themselves to figure out what works for them.
I'm going to Senegal in 3 weeks. I'm going because I want to absorb the local flavor and culture and play with musicians there who have a radically different sensibility and feel than I do. Hopefully a little will rub off on me and while I'm there I will write something different than my normal work and feel inspired and like I'm moving forward in my development as a musician. Africa has some very strong primal creative energy that I feel intensely when I'm there. This will be my 3rd trip. Getting psyched!
Andrew Kolpakov (2012-12-02) #Very insightful article! Thanks Derek!
I have a feeling that the most beautiful places on Earth are created by local people whereas the least livable and the least sustainable cities are created by global. (Or these cities are populated with global people
If you stick with a place till the end of your life, if you have built a house there and you know that you'll never move to any other place, then you try to make your place the best it can be.
If you don't, you don't care about what surrounds you. You admire other beautiful places (like a small village in the Alps or in Iceland), you think about how nice it will be to live there, but you don't contribute to your local city.
I tend to be global. And that's what scares me
Marco Brantner (2012-12-02) #Thanks for sharing your thoughts Derek... love it.
I think when people live globally they are more open minded and aware off the fact that there are different realities in the same world while, in the other hand when people live locally they assume that there's only one reality in the world... their own reality.
I would dare to say that global people are more unstable (and maybe more confused emotionally) but they also feel more free, more alive .
Greetings to everyone
Derrik Jordan (2012-12-02) #One more thing:
Think globally, listen locally (and globally!)
Botielus (2012-12-02) #Good stuff. I keep saying I want to break free from the local (gigs) and start my composing back up. I just need to DO IT!!
Joachim Stroh (2012-12-02) #Yay! Derek's back!

Geri Rizzo (2012-12-02) #You're so right!  I actually grew up around Woodstock!
I'm concentrating on doing what it takes to make money playing any genre of music and seeing myself there and it works, but also starting to get some of my songs out there that I've sat on for years.  Yep, a hermit like you, expect when I perform!  Glad to hear from you, and don't be a stranger!
Cathy Main (2012-12-02) #Glad to hear from you, Derek!
I feel like an old friend just called me out of the blue!
Dad (2012-12-02) #I'm reminded of the bazillion times my wife has reminded me that we programmers so often seem to see things as binary when in fact it's a gradient or spectrum and the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; answer is at neither extreme.
Which means that I suspect some balance of the two is probably where the sweet spot is.  Where along the spectrum one is happiest, most energized, and most productive in a long-term sustainable way will differ based on our differing personalities of course, but rarely is either endpoint the right answer (bell curve for likely distribution?  Be an interesting experiment to run).
I personally find that, while it's easy to feel like the electronically mediated socializing is sufficient, in reality something is missing that only in-person social interaction provides.  Is it just the increased bandwidth of in-person communication? (body-language including facial expressions, tone of voice, etc).  Or maybe something less well understood like pheromones perhaps?
(News Flash:  &amp;quot;Skype 2020 now includes pheromone receptors and synthesizers to take video communication to the next level!&amp;quot;  :-P ).
I hope you can find a balance of the two because, based on my experience, I suspect this is the state in which you will be happiest/most-fulfilled (of course my experience might not apply to you at all ).
peace.
Loren Weisman (2012-12-02) #Thanks for the article Derek,
It is crucial to act global and for musicians, be in places where they can reach more audiences, more often at less of a cost.
Otherwise, they end up being that band that never gets out of their backyard.
Shrutarshi Basu (2012-12-02) #Aren't you conflating two separate issues: local vs global and taking vs doing? Couldn't you try meeting a group of local people with whom you actually worked and created on a regular basis? Personally, most of the people I interact with work in the same building and live within a few square miles. But we're all working and building and publishing. Though I have friends across the global, we mostly just talk about things (which is always fun) but never really create anything together.
Terry Dossey (2012-12-02) #Derek, your post helped me understand the basis for an ongoing conflict I've had with my songwriting partner of many years.
Coming from a background as a university scientist, my focus was always global, putting another brick in the wall of human knowledge for the benefit of everyone.  Having switched to being a musician, my focus remains global and thus I hardly notice the people around me at live shows as I'm thinking songwriting, recording, internet radio, collaborating with musicians over the internet, creating compositions and works that will hopefully be heard and evoke thoughts and feelings in people of many countries.
My partner, on the other hand, is focused locally and the interaction with all those people at the live shows, the attention and appreciation and smiles are EVERYTHING to her.   I'll think on this and see if I can somehow meet her where she's focused to the benefit of us both.  Thank you!
Bob Blackshear (2012-12-02) #Dear Derek:
You are a person with a fine, bright mind who just happens to be an entrepreneur.  For those of us who are unable to travel and perform, how can we penetrate the seemingly impenetrable? It's neat to have someone download your songs from  afar, but what about those countries  where this is not possible? Could you make this a quest! Maybe you already have.
Local is cool, but going global if infinitely cooler for those of us who are not able to travel. This goes out for all of us seventy year old songwriters.
Blessings,
Bob
Jake Buckley-Fortin (2012-12-02) #Love #78's comment above.
Something about this essay doesn't feel honest to me. And I say that as a big fan.
In practice I'm very much on the &amp;quot;global&amp;quot; side of the equation. But the reasoning provided be Derek here feels a little like trying to justify natural introversion (which has never needed justification) while endorsing intentional isolation from people and the environment around you — a modern trend that I find more troubling as I get older.
The other sense I get from many commenters — and I'm pretty sure this wasn't Derek's intent — is that their lives would be better if they were just &amp;quot;more global&amp;quot;. But the sad fact is that many people don't have anything meaningful to contribute on the global stage, and their modest efforts would be more appreciated if applied locally.
Dean Taylor (2012-12-02) #What an extraordinary post! I think you have nailed on the head what many people feel but haven't taken the time or have had the insight to put into words. It seems it has had an epiphanistic(?) effect on some! I know it has resonated with me but I hadn't realized what it was I was feeling. Thanks!
Betty Johnson (2012-12-02) #My, you are always interesting.  thank you for writing and including comments.
My life;
Last summer I was asked by the University of North Carolina (the state where I was born} to give them my life in music for the library archives.  It was quite a large mailing - as you can imagine! My daughters, Lydia and Elisabeth Gray, convinced me that we should give another concert, but I had sent all the arrangements and music to UNC! They told me to just &amp;quot;show up&amp;quot; - I can always think of something! I did and it was a glorious experience.  Just being able to sing with the third generation, my daughters, was a gift to be remembered.  The experience of performing and having an audience love your music and responding to our love is something so special that it cannot be described!
Derek - you rekindled my career with CD Baby.  Now that you are in China, I take great notice in the fact that downloading my catalogue of music is world wide and especially where you are! Thank you for everything, Derek and please keep me posted! Love and hugs, Betty

Michael ONeill (2012-12-02) #I always enjoy your writing's Derek. You inspire and validate the artist in me and always have. I joined CD baby with my first independent release after being released from WB's. I have sent so many artist's the CD baby way. I played the rambel in Woodstock a while back and wondered why it took me so long to get to Woodstock the land of my forefathers. I live and write now from a studio over looking the Puget Sound in the Great Northwest. I connect locally by by producing a weekly radio show on the community radio station from my studio. Then also produce a monthly live touring artist showcase &amp;quot;Americana Music Series&amp;quot; again educating humans about the touring artist. But I travel and connect globally far more then my balance in the local market. Bigger is better !! you are a trail blazer ...... thanks

Tim Nenninger (2012-12-02) #Yeah!  So great to have you back Derek.  I really appreciate your words.  I too am globally minded and have struggled my whole life with that (still do).

Grant (2012-12-02) #Thank you Derek for sharing your insight. I hadn't realised, but in my struggle to find my true calling and to move forward into it, this has been a real issue for me. Your words have provided real clarity for me and helped me sort my thoughts. Now I think I can explain those feelings of frustration and lack of satisfaction at the end of the day. I am definitely global in the way I think, feel and see things, and I am glad you have been with these ideas, coz otherwise I would not have had the benefit if reading this today from Melbourne, Australia!
Lisa M. Robbin (Young) (2012-12-02) #I'm so glad you vocalized this. I have a soft spot for the community I grew up it, but was clear from a very young age that I was a global kind of girl. I knew my mission was meant for beyond the realms of my neighborhood, and it wasn't until I started exploring the web of &amp;quot;out there&amp;quot; that I felt resonance. Then, I dealt with my local friends and colleagues who kept saying &amp;quot;what have you done for us lately?&amp;quot; and it felt sort of guilt-trippy, whether they intended it that way or not.
I've been lucky to have found a balance between writing and sending my great work into the world, and connecting and sharing my gifts locally. That's not been an easy task, though, and with children, the task gets infinitely more challenging. But OH, is it SO worth it when the plates are spinning at just the right speed and it's all working like a well-oiled machine.  I'm still more globally oriented, and this post helped me shake some of the guilt I was feeling because of it.
Always a blessing, Derek. Welcome back!
Melissa Ferrick (2012-12-02) #Ah Derek you sound good  deep in thought and action.
For me, it is important to remember that when i find myself &amp;quot;not connecting&amp;quot; to my local or global community i have to be careful to not get stuck in self defeating thought patterns which ultimately just breeds inaction. I find it's important for me to give constantly, otherwise i get full of fear, greed, and a terrible negative itch about &amp;quot;everybody else&amp;quot;
If i stay out of my own way and engaged in being of service, my chances of being inspired are at least tripled
The saying,...&amp;quot;it is in giving that i receive&amp;quot; is so true and applicable either locally or globally. Love you tons.

Thank the Gods - he's back!
Derek, we need your navigational assistance in this new music world.
When you get yourself a coffee and a nice comfy chair, please consider writing about streaming, what it means for us; how we can become our own gatekeepers.  In short, how can we Not give it all away, as musicians have done in the past.
If we're going to streaming and that's what it looks like and it comes down to a few streaming services, where will that leave us?
Would you consider starting a streaming service yourself?  Let me rephrase that:  STart one and be the cool indie streaming service before anyone;)
Also, what do you think of the breakdown in revenue streams that Spodify is using?
Early on, you used to suggest &amp;quot;go for everything that pays.&amp;quot;
For people starting out, I used to agree with you.  Now I'm not so sure.  Do you still feel this way?
Would really love to hear your thoughts.
Thanks so much,
A.
PS You, local?  Seriously?

RaVen Sequoia (2012-12-02) #Hi Derek,
This not being local article really hit home for me... I have moved to many states in the US and lived with relatives in Europe and South America and nowhere feels like home. Moved to Colorado and still I'm not able to connect with many locals - one has to do that I am Culturally Deaf and fluent in ASL - 99.9% of the population is not fluent in sign language; I'm an atheist so forget churches; and due to the fact that I have thyroid disease, I'm unable to travel as much as I would like... however I hope to someday figure a way to travel &amp;amp; meet international folks worldwide while I'm still young and abled.  My hearing family who are fluent in 3 spoken foreign languages refuses to learn ASL because &amp;quot;You're too far away, what's the point?!&amp;quot; Thanks for sharing your honest insights --- nice for some of us to identify similar experiences.
Best wishes and Happy Holidays!
Paul Crepeau (2012-12-02) #then we will find much satisfaction. When a husband and father looks diligently after the needs of his immediate family while acknowledging that every other family is equally important, he is doing the best he can do, because strong and close families combine to make a strong and close global family. We are like ants in an ant colony, yet more than that because desire to see everyone everyone everywhere succeed as a human being.
EricMakesMusic (2012-12-02) #This why you're in the inner circle of people that I consider a mentor - your experiences allow you to confirm the things I've only wondered about. I love the conclusion you've reached. I think I've always been globally focused as well. And, I've been strongly considering following some opportunities that would require me to be local for a while. But this post really clarifies things for me. I think you just kept me from wasting a few years. Thanks.

Rob Ambrosino (2012-12-02) #Great to hear, Derek. While marketing a conferencing thing way back in 2003, I found that by leaving the room open all day, I was really connected to lots of people around the world who were all working on their own projects. The only thing we had in common was that we were all marketing the conf. room and we had a &amp;quot;project.&amp;quot; One guy was a web designer from North Carolina, one lady was a web tutor from California, another guy owned a coffee shop in Washington State and was literally checking in with us while operating his &amp;quot;drive-thru coffee bar.&amp;quot; He was also the local open-mic hosting place. Some other guy was a &amp;quot;sales coach.&amp;quot; Talking with these people on a daily basis fed MY projects. Low and behold, on New Year's Eve, one of the guys owned several radio stations, fell in love with one of my songs and aired it in the Carribean on New Year's Eve. Then he bought a few CD's from CD Baby. I am still in touch with those productive people from the conf. room company to this day. The conf. software morphed into something else and we all went our separate ways, but all kept in touch to &amp;quot;feed the need.&amp;quot; I guess being &amp;quot;global&amp;quot; can feel &amp;quot;more local&amp;quot; now.  I think it's better to stay plugged into the production crowd globally and stay &amp;quot;always-evolving on the web.&amp;quot; I feel global connections are better. The locals will figure it out eventually anyway. Thanks Derek, I can really relate to your story.
Erin Wilson (2012-12-02) #I've often thought how grateful I am to be born in this time, when being globally-oriented is an actual choice.  I'm quite sure, had I been born 200 years ago, I'd have been the town melancholic who finally drown herself in the well.  I'm only half-kidding.
I hope I can help other women, who don't yet have the same options I do, find their way.

T Scott Walker (2012-12-02) #Derek - if you didn't find yourself attached to family and close friends that you desire to wine and dine with on a regular basis then I would agree that you are global based.
Problem I have had over the years is I'm very found of my community organizations, Kiwanis, Village Merchants, Churches,Habitat etc but I also dersire in my music business to reach out globally. It's always been a catch 22 for me. Anyway, thanks for the insight and sharing your perspective. Your a brilliant thinker, keep it comin'- tsw

radha (2012-12-02) #I recently returned from a round the world musical journey.  Left Los Angeles via Singapore and returned via Amsterdam.  The music I performed in India was with a Domican Republic group and a Portugese classical pianist.  The music played in Amsterdam was with an Indian classical/jazz singer.  It was great to be out in the world connected with humanity through music.  I do not anyone in my town in California but the world is right there waiting for other cultural artforms.
Sam (2012-12-02) #great article, Derek!  It's more relevant than ever these days as I think most of the tech world (99%) is focused on global.  This is actually becoming a problem socially and can make it very difficult to 'be present' in your 5 square mile radius.
My way of coping is simply unplugging and walking for at least an hour.  Another tip is hoping on a random bus and discovering a new part of town.  This can work wonders for 'home town burn-out'
When that stops working though, it may be time for a mini-retirement to far flung countries.  That's a sure-fire reset button
Joe Pickering Jr. (2012-12-02) #Thank you for sharing Derek....happy that you are starting another phase or turning to the next cycle in your life.  Local?  Global? Can the lines be drawn in this way?   We all live within a universe of ourselves. None of us truly knows the impact that we are having at any level whether local or global.   Maybe, all of us live in both from time to time at different stages of our lives.  As for your comment below if someone gives their commitment to a business, shouldn't they be acknowledged for their commitment? Why is that &amp;quot;cronyism&amp;quot;? People make choices in life on where they work and live. Derek you are to admired for your lack of labeling. But, to put the label of &amp;quot;cronyism&amp;quot; where you didn't use any in your excellent article....were you having a &amp;quot;bad hair day?&amp;quot; (which would be difficult for you)  Or, am I labeling too?? lol
In business, they give preferential treatment to their inside circle. (This is cronyism.)
Brad Parker (2012-12-02) #It's always wonderful to hear from you!
I do believe we have stages of life, as well a choices during those stages.  How often I think of where I grew up, and where I wandered to, and even if I wanted to go back to the beginning, to feel what once was.  That all exists within, and is neither here nor there.
Success, I'm finding these days, is so very unpredictable!  Life, even with the best plan is still a random crap shoot, but oh what a ride!
However, I so think money allows us to make choices more than any other single thing.  When there is little or none, choices are based in the urgency of existence.
Roy Hedges (2012-12-02) #I think it's a great idea. constant contact with the world is kind of horrible and still always sounds lonely and painful to me. Since you've made contact and given the world cd baby maybe it's just better to keep the rest for yourself? Encouraging hoards of mediocrity to capitalise on worlview communications is certainly not making the end product any better.

Terry Dossey (2012-12-02) #I'd like to add a less philosophical and more practical comment for those who might benefit from it.  Everyone knows that global music distribution is available to the struggling artist (CD Baby was a pioneer of that) but maybe some don't realize that global performance of live music is now readily available, easily done, and often pays as well or better than, say, a coffee shop in Austin TX.
I'm speaking of Second Life (www.secondlife.com), where one can stream up music to a global audience and be paid in real money.  The people attending are generous in their tipping and for the most part are people who stopped driving downtown and dealing with parking and babysitters and $10 beer a long time ago, but they still buy CDs and downloads.  There are many venues in SL, some SL musicians have management and make as much as $100/hr or more performing from their own homes.

This is despite settling into the UK again after leaving Canada for Saudi, Saudi for the UK, the UK (in 2010) for Qatar and Qatar back for the UK.
I am where I am, but my mission relates to helping people everywhere, as a writer, artist, arts manager, coach and consultant. Thank you for making this distinction so CLEAR.
Blessings to you in your continued journey, Derek. I'm so glad a friend forwarded this on to me. I must have missed it.

James Olinda (2012-12-02) #I hadn't considered this idea fully.  Sometimes I think I'm just now discovering that the two exist, and being able to see the local and global thought processes really expands your mind.  Because once you see them, you're able to make an educated choice about which would be better for you.  Great thoughts, good to hear from you!
Elvira (2012-12-02) #Hi Derek. I enjoyed your artical and feel the same.
I've moved so many times in my life that I don't feel that I belong to particular place, reather would call myself a world citizen. I was born in Ukraine, lived in Budapest (Hungary), Germany, Tokio, Israel, NJ, recently moved to PA and have trevaled to Sweden, France, Austria, Poland, Russia and all over the US. I also feel, think and act globally and was never involved with community in any place I used to live and don't plan on this. I think you should follow your feelings and intuition and not wasting your time on things that aren't interesting for you. That's the reason you are exhousted and feel drained by someone. Have a great week and holiday time
Elvira.
Matthew Skoller (2012-12-02) #You pose an unnecessary dichotomy. We are (like it or not) both local and global. And when it comes to certain subjects like the survival of this very troubled planet, it will be the global realization that things like food need to be locally sourced and communally shared. I played music in Japan and Italy this year as well as next to little farmer's market's in the West Side ghetto here in Chicago, not far from my own neighborhood. The department of Cultural affairs here in Chicago hired me to help attract attention to fresh food stands in what has been called a &amp;quot;food desert&amp;quot;.  We reach out globally and with our experience and knowledge we engage locally and become part of our community, that is called civilization.
Totally agree about the local food point. I was going to mention this in the article, but felt it was too off-topic. -- Derek
Madelyn Collins (2012-12-02) #Yay! Great to read a new post by you, Derek! I've missed them.

Jason Arnold (2012-12-02) #Excellent article, Derek. It gives me a different perspective on some of my own decisions made just recently. To a certain extent, I've targeted my efforts more globally in the past, but I'm definitely leaning toward the local end of the spectrum at the moment, and am very happy about it. Thank you for the insight.
Laura Fernandez (2012-12-02) #Derek
So great to hear from you!
I am at a point in my life where I  need to make this decision. I was globally raised but now have become locally entrenched in my community, not feeling happy being just local. It is time to spread my wings and focus on writing and my work. It is true when your energy becomes sapped from too much local interaction. your creative force suffers. Thank you for this and your inspiring insights.
Very timely.
Jordan Biel (2012-12-02) #We missed you man!  Loved this article!  I've always had a desire to create things that have a global impact from music to websites...

David Nevue (2012-12-02) #Outstanding post!
Bob Forbes (2012-12-02) #Way to go Derek - you're local to the world ;^))
Say, on the subject about writing and recording music - what do you think of Joe Walsh's comments at &amp;quot;Daryls House (episode #60) saying record sales is dead and gone? Interesting coming from him.
Andrew Kolpakov (2012-12-02) #After I've written the first comment I started thinking more intensely.
If you are a programmer or a designer, there is absolutely no sense in being 'local' in your job. The same for mathematicians, musicians, writers. Basically, what they create is a new knowledge that can be shared with no expenses. You don't even need to collaborate with the people in your city — the whole world would be better off if you are collaborating without geographical boundaries.
As for me, I like doing something what can be shared globally. I have the sense of accomplishment and I can be proud of the result. (Unfortunately, I don't feel that satisfaction when I help one person struggling with the computer. But I feel the satisfaction after writing an article about solving this problem.)
That's one part. But there is another dimension of being local/global. It is more geographical and refers to our daily activities and to socializing. You can not do this globally.
Basically, what Derek described, is 'I want to spend less time hanging around with people and more time working on something'.
Another local/global equation is 'I want my work to have local or global impact'. For example, a flower shop worker, a dentist or a teacher want to deeply improve life of one person. (Another teacher may want to improve the whole industry by inventing a new teaching method and sharing it with others.)
For me, the former equation is about finding balance (probably not a balance on daily basis but a balance of weekly/monthly/yearly basis because you may want to recharge your batteries and feel the calling for a new project).
The latter is about making a choice. But not about making a choice and sticking with it. It's about discovering yourself and going with the natural flow of things.
Very well-put. Thank you. I think I missed the mark because many people think I'm talking about not having friends. But I'm really just referring to the business side of things. After spending hundreds of hours helping out my local Singapore scene, I'd prefer to do less in-person work, and focus my attention on creating things for the world.  The difference between teaching a class and writing a book, I guess. -- Derek
Max Davis (2012-12-02) #Thankfully, we're all a work in progress. Your shared insights remind me of the many turns and blind corners you find in any man's journey. The world is ours so I vote global - and doesn't global also contain local?
Jose Castro-Frenzel (2012-12-02) #What a great article.  It really made me reflect on my own life and how one should really choose how they want to live.  It's refreshing reading your blog,  I am happy to hear there is more coming.  I think your blog has helped many globally! =)  Thanks Derek!!
Mary Connors-Carson (2012-12-02) #First of all- Is that a pic of where you live now Derek? One slim road in and out, SDcotland or Ireland maybe? Then it appears perfect!  And I guess it boils down to doing what comes naturally- be it building a local community and assisting with important projects within your own town or helping to stop world hunger http://www.results.org/   I suspect one can be both- bi-lobal?  ;) Thank you again- I always enjoy your missives.

Kerry Dexter (2012-12-02) #good thoughts, Derek. I do think for some of us things go in cycles, to a certain extent, even within one focus or another. I have a strong global focus and, like you, have close ties and good freinds in several parts of the globe. I miss being able to share a cup of tea or an afternoon's conversation with  those good friends face to face at present. my focus and work is global -- so is that of almost all ny close friends -- and sometimes good inspirations for that come from in person connection with friends. rather different than the sorts of draining local interactions you mention (I've done those too) but still a thought.
Zoltan Paulini (2012-12-02) #If I knew you were in Singapore, I would have visited you! Maybe in Brazil, next time!
We are always unhappy with our state: if we are local, we want to be global and vice-versa. But the good question is how to help others better: I see the, local or global, there is much need of help everywhere. Our mission is to spread the beauty to all souls.
Rich K Young (2012-12-02) #Good topic for discussion!  When your heart is in the right place, you find opportunities to build better communities whether they be local or global.  I am so fortunate that I am in a community with a truly interfaith organization where Jews and Christians and Buddhists and Muslims and Baha'is and those how have not chosen a particular religion come together to house and feed not only those in the local area, but also world wide.  Music is a big part of what we do because music uplifts the spirit and is part of every culture.   Working together, we create a better world both locally and globally.  http://www.oly-wa.us/interfaith/

Paul Manchester (2012-12-02) #Your points are well made.  It is a changing world.  I also loved reading the discussion in the comments after reading your thoughts.  It is still difficult to see how profoundly the world is going to change with this new internet thing.  Most of my graphics and illustration work is done through the internet- frequently never actually meeting the client in person.  I have friends in so many places that I have never met in person- yet I still care for them and what happens to them.  Teenagers are playing video games with kids in Russia and India and Singapore- when politicians want to start wars it is more difficult to paint the enemy as beasts to slaughter- because we've met these people.  Profound changes that we are only at the brink of.  I'm an optimist.  I think there is potentially much that is good in the future.  So I applaud your global thoughts.  Both paths are full of beautiful experiences- but it would be exciting to see our planet discover its potential.
Hughie (2012-12-02) #Welcome back, Derek.
As usual, you have expressed very neatly something that has been playing on my mind recently. Thanks for that.
I'm wondering, though, whether anyone can be completely outward focused. Surely there has to be a minimum of local support for your global ideas and effort? Can you find that from temporary communities or can that come from the global community?
More food for thought ...
Jean Burman (2012-12-02) #You're starting another revolution here Derek... you know that don't you? LOL
I spent time in Europe earlier this year thinking I might work from there. But after a few months I missed Australia and its easy going lifestyle.
What I did notice while I was there however was that people are the same wherever you go. France is a village just as Australia is. People interact eat play and work just the same.
What I took away from the experience was the sure knowledge that I can do anything from anywhere. I don't have to BE in one place.
Of course it helps practically to have a home base... but from there [wherever THERE is] all things are possible.  You can go global from local down town anywhere.
I like that!
Thanks Derek.  It's great to hear from you again. You always make so much sense
R. Scott (2012-12-02) #I can totally relate. Just finishing a record, it's time to play out. Lotsa of local, now global!
Sarah Dopp (2012-12-02) #Yep, you just nailed it.  I get hit with a sense of guilt and incompleteness either way, but at the end of the day, global is far more satisfying to me than local. Perhaps time to just accept that.
Alex Reinlieb (2012-12-02) #Great article! I've always found it tough to find people with many of the same interests locally. To that point, it's amazing to have the ability to connect with the world and not be limited by location.
Warren Harrison (2012-12-02) #I actually struggled with similar conflicting emotions on this one. After some research I learned that my nature is pretty extreme introversion. This makes the 'local' that much more of a challenge. The burn out is pretty quick, and I in turn recognize that as a failure within myself. My appetite for releasing music online and maintaining and contributing to open source projects seems to have no bounds, however. It's much the same end result (arguably the 'global' approach yields further reaching results) but I think one's personality and character is what determines which works for us.
Great article, as always.

I also believe our success in life can only be measured by how well we foster and manage those relationships.
Derek I admire your writings, but feel a bit sad if not puzzled by your lack of  friendships. Someone with insight such as yours has a gift. And, if that gift has been cultivated in a vacuum ( other than your experimental time in Singapore )....imagine the result of striking a natural balance between both global relationships and local ones!
Jean Burman (2012-12-02) #Oh... and I should also say that I concur wholeheartedly with Paul Manchester above that the potential for a more harmonious world is being greatly enhanced by our global interconnectivity via the net.  Most of us by now have friends from all over we've never actually met but for whom we have regard concern and compassion. What the world needs now...
Mark Pinkus (2012-12-02) #hi Derek, great to hear from you after all these months. I'l simply say, my slogan has always been:&amp;quot; think global, not local.&amp;quot; what I mean there is that the world is a huge place and I have always sold and distributed my solo piano cds worldwide, Each day I look around the world for places to place and sell my music. If I was to focus mostly locally I simply wouldn't be making a living. Music like they say is a universal language, beyond the local borders. I live here but my mind is to reach out around the world. that's my approach to the music biz. Happy and peaceful holidays to you Derek. Mark
Elle Fagan Arts (2012-12-02) #Food for thought!  Thank you - I read the article because of CDbaby - I once did an album cover for one of CDbaby's classical projects. An honor.
Not surprised that you did so locally in Singapore. It would have been irresistible - the pull to go exploring a culture different from your own.
Somehow, there are times in life , especially for those who create, to simply go pad about and regenerate, learn  new things, etc.  It works. It's valid. NO apologies should be needed.
In my business, I am getting so that, if the local projects are not sailing in fairwinds, I simply focus &amp;quot;otherwheres&amp;quot;, and vice-versa. Funny that the concept holds water.
Personally:   My family once lived all in the same town - today we have our  own stratosphere , so many of us, living all around the globe - and it is wonderful thanks to modern communications, we speak globally for nearly free.  And that is usually all it takes.
Happy Holiday and I still wish my entire family were here for Christmas once in a while , just to refresh / restore.

What a great date!
Derek, very thought provoking!
The aye's have it! Its unanimous!
There are 'some' merits for the local scene!
But they are far out-weighed by the on-line
phenomenon!
Virtually overnight with the available  social-
business sights, I've increased my network by
thousands of per cent!
That sort of thing doesn't exist on the local front!
The data transfer business has grown so quickly,
I haven't mailed anyone anything in years!
I have a wonderful electronic press kit chock full
of everything that I need to promote us and our
music!
Click, its in China, Germany, Rio or anywhere!
2 seconds to anywhere in the world! Click!
And the net's becoming more expedited and
sophisticated every day!
Nothing on the local scene tops that...plus, you get
a 'wary' eye from people wondering what the hell
you're doing in podunk!
Long Live the internet..savior of musicians and our
careers!
Greg &amp;amp; Junko MacDonald (2012-12-02) #Derek, I've written you before, even way back at the beginning of CD Baby.  You made web stuff real easy for the non-tech musicians like me.  Can't thank you enough.
But, I'd like to comment on this recent email from you.  Playing the Caribbean steel pan in Hawaii is like the devil trying to be accepted in church.  I realized there's about a million people in Hawaii and 7 billion on the planet and that my focus needed to be global, which it is.  However, for philosophical fun, I'd challenge you on your idea that focusing on one or the other is a choice.  I think not.  I think we are drawn to one or the other, like a bee to flowers, and hence, it's not a choice.  Therefore, if I were editing your letter I'd talk about paying attention to what pulls you.  A flower tunes to follow the sun all day, it's not a choice.  A musician doesn't so much choose his/her instrument as much as knowing which one feels best.  Again, not a choice.
This has been just a little philosophical fun for you to kick around.  No matter what, you have made a huge impact on my life and I thank you for that.
Aloha
Rachit Khator (2012-12-02) #I completely admire your writings Derek. And this is something, I had in my mind few months ago. How can one be locally global or vice-versa? I even wrote something on my blog about it. And I remember watching a TED Talk regarding the same, here's the link: http://www.ted.com/talks/sheikha_al_mayassa_globalizing_the_local_localizing_the_global.html.
I see the interconnectivity between the both as an attribute of a social and inquisitive mind. I am sure you can be both at the same time ensuring the way technology has progressed over time to keep up with the relationships over the world. As a student, I always try my level best to keep in touch with friends and acquaintances all over the world by sharing resources or experiences and thats how I feel connected. I wish the same to you. Keep up your good health. Cheers!
SgtDunson (2012-12-02) #First off wow I never realized how long your mailing list is and the people that follow you. Thanks for contacting me back almost everytime I write you. Secondly today brother you have answered a feeling I have been having for a wow now as you know I live in Las Vegas, and theirs a very small local scene here but I just never felt like I belonged. The top of 2013 I had planned to be involved with them more but this article made me realize what I have always felt... I'm just not local I lived in Fairbanks, Alaska, all over California North and South, Las Vegas and even Iraq for a year and a half. My point is like you I feel obligated to all those communities and more. Thanks for sharing your truth self Derek.
Susan Alexander (2012-12-02) #Derek:
You're the only writer whose email I click on and read right when it comes in.  It's always a delight to read your thoughts - on anything, whatever they are.
What a good point you make here - I hadn't thought about it in these terms, but my current venture (Version 2.0 of my idea, launching soon) has good potential for balancing the local/global thing.
I didn't know of you in your CD Baby days, but what a great effort that was.  It helped a lot of people get their work out there.  Lucky for me and many others that you wrote a book about it (a nice, short memorable one with a cool cover, no less!).
I think about things I've learned from you all the time.  It's  super fuel for what I'm doing.  So ... thanks for not keeping it to yourself, or local.
I hope to see you speak sometime.  How cool it would be if you'd come to New York.

Ben Scherrey (2012-12-02) #Geez your timing is so prescient Derek - it scares me. I get what you mean about burning hours with questionable value in one-on-one meetings (have had one such long phone call with you before as you'll recall) but some of those have also been of the most benefit to me as well. Personally I prefer the intimate conversations but, of course, there's gotta be something that holds my interest.
I've been running my webservices company with no local clients for a few years now and have only this year taken on a few local clients. On top of that, a few weeks ago I just made either a brilliant investment or one of the top 5 mistakes in my life by becoming the partner of a restaurant/bar in hopes of turning it around and making it the premiere venue for original live music performances in Bangkok named, of all things..... Woodstock. Yeah really.  Do drop by next time you're in town.
Clara Bellino (2012-12-02) #Enjoyed your article Derek. Funny I had a conversation about something similar last night; I just got back from my 3rd visit to L.A. in a short time. And I'm really excited because my calling or, the way I can help other artists in a way that feels authentic, has revealed itself to me. It's always been clear to me that musically I'm reaching beyond my local community. As an international artist I attended and presented a workshop at the IMC in October, and all the artists who asked to be mentored by me were international, from all over the world. I met with some of them again this time. And while a local community is very important to those who support each other through it, and I continue when I have time to share with it insights I think might be helpful, I feel much more connected to &amp;quot;global&amp;quot; than &amp;quot;local&amp;quot;. Working with these artists is much more exciting to me, there's such various input. That's where I feel alive. No right or wrong. And it may have to do with the fact that I was born in France, have traveled extensively and have lived in many countries...
Mauri Moore (2012-12-02) #I feel exactly the same.  I tried, but never could get into the local effort with all my heart.  Global nomads forever!
Jonathan (2012-12-02) #Great article Derek! It's nice to see you back online, I was wondering when you'd come back here. I'd say I'm more &amp;quot;global&amp;quot; myself. I'm building up a business that will solely live online. I like the idea of being able to live anywhere and everywhere and still have a great business. I'm an introvert, so naturally I feel &amp;quot;at home&amp;quot; online. I'm sure I could be local, but more often than not I feel more comfortable reaching out to others in distant lands than I do my neighbors. It's been great for me though, I've lived in Japan, Korea, Kuwait and back in the US and while I enjoyed living in all those places (except Kuwait) online is where I belong. I also met my wife to be online. She lives in the Philippines and I will be leaving at the end of the month to get married down there. No need to be local when there's so much more out there to experience. After all that though, I'm looking forward to living in a nice quiet place of the world. I'd love to live in a small place like the picture above with a nice small community to get involved with.
Lyle Hotchkiss (2012-12-02) #Very interesting, and very well written.  There is a societal pressure to live an intimate, narrow life style...it's &amp;quot;politically correct,&amp;quot;  you know. But if everyone lived in an entirely closed world, that world would never expand.  It's OK, probably even beneficial to society, for those who thrive on such an existence to live that way, but if it were not for those who see such security as an entrapment, few great accomplishments would ever happen.
Drew D'Agostino (2012-12-02) #Thanks for this piece Derek!
If you don't separate these two ways of thinking, it could be easy to feel guilty for not participating in one or the other. I can think of specific times in my life when I've felt how you did about Woodstock.
I'm sensing that I too prefer a global focus. The thing is, I think most people in the world are locally focused. There's such benefits of both....
There's really something to be said for meeting up with &amp;quot;the guy around the corner&amp;quot; on a whim. Or having 5 or so people you can just do that with. Do you have to sacrifice that to have a global focus?
Barbara (2012-12-02) #Hi Derek
Bang on, as always.  But next time you come to the UK, I hope you'll still do your &amp;quot;open-cafe&amp;quot; invitation so we can say &amp;quot;Hi&amp;quot;.
As we connect more and more with people who share our perspective and as we evolve, I think we are going to feel less pull towards the &amp;quot;local&amp;quot; for its own sake, but nevertheless, we still need to be connected to our environments...
But in terms of leverage, I think serving the most people with your highest good is the most important thing...

Wyn Barratt (2012-12-02) #Hi Derek,
I'm old and forgetful (84) and at first your name didn't 'click' till you mentioned CDbaby and I remembered the humerous messages you sent with my orders.
Jeff Gorick is still my very favourite musician and song writer after a couple of serious illnesses set him aside for a long time.
It is so good to hear from you again and your humour and vitality is still going full bore and sparked me up quite a bit!
I'm happy you are going global again. We are a bit out of the loop down here in 'OZ'.
Every blessing to you and zillions of opportunities to touch us all,
Wyn
Elaine Menardi (2012-12-02) #Thanks... I was feeling so guilty for not wanting to be local anymore.  I shipped!  And it's going to require being global from a tiny little town on the plains.  Onward!
Winfield Marine (2012-12-02) #Thanks for your insight.  Have a great day.
Courtney Yasmineh (2012-12-02) #Derek,
I've been an independent musician selling my work through CDBaby for ten years.
When I started I had little kids so it was easier to write and record during the day than to play shows at night.
The local music writers showed no interest in my work,
partly I think because I was a Chicago transplant
living and recording in Minneapolis.
If I played a local show I didn't have friends and family to bolster my audience so I didn't appear to be popular.
The world came to me at first.
Lufthansa Airlines used my songs
for their in flight playlist and contacted me through CDBaby.
Many European roots and americana DJs did the same.
I am, in early 2013, releasing my fifth studio album of original material.
My band will do our sixth independent tour in Europe
in March 2013.
The Minneapolis music scene is starting to like me.
They invite my band to play some of their big local events like their Aquatennial Celebration.
I feel like I am going where the love is and as I go along
its starting to flesh out into an authentic existence for me.
This year I also have a grant to teach songwriting and record songs with high risk troubled teens in the public schools here.
The grant is from the Minnesota Arts Board.
Its kinda, for me, like I had to go out into the world in order to gain acceptance on the local level because I am not local by nature.
I am thrilled and grateful that its all starting to make sense for me.
You are fabulous.
You have helped me, through your writings and your endeavors, get where I'm getting.
Love and Respect, Courtney

Dev Basu (2012-12-02) #I was wondering why there was radio silence from your end and lo and behold, your post is exactly what's been on my mind for a couple of weeks now. I have no doubt I'm more of a global person than a local one.
It's not just that I love traveling and experiencing new cultures (actually integrating as best I can) but I like the fact that it's completely possible to do great things with people half way around the world and still have relationships that are close to the 'real thing', i.e: meeting in person.
Setting that aside for just a moment, I've come to realize that whether you spend your time building your local community or connecting with a global one, at a certain tipping point you build up a network that is interconnected across the globe.
Mr Twenty Twenty (2012-12-02) #Hi Derek,
Great personal share with great distinctions worth exploring.  You have found your next way of being in the world, how cool.
What I love about your share, is that it uses the head, to come from the heart, so you can be true in your body and world.     It's not just something to think about, or another almost useless distinction to make, it is something that is about you being more true, more real, more alive.
Many blessings my friend,
Mr Twenty Twenty
Gary Pickus (2012-12-02) #Derek,
Very interesting topic, and another provocative introspection from you.
I relate very well.
It is a strange world when we can be deeply involved with so many hundreds, thousands miles away, and have no clue who our neighbors are within walking distance.
Business-wise I am currently gigging as a pianist-vocalist from the Caribbean to the entire East Coast, have a brand new smartphone app (WOOGEY-it plays music based on names) out in the US -with a Latin category-, and still trying to gain traction for an international collaboration foundation.
So my answer for myself is definitely global...and nothing spells global like the internet....however... I like to know who is delivering my mail and where the nearest golf driving range is!

Jeff Pasquale (2012-12-02) #I think we’ve preconditioned (or pre-biased) ourselves, too, into thinking that if someone we know is local, a longer conversation should take place in person and not on the phone or via email.
I’ve caught myself doing this occasionally. I feel almost compelled to spend in-person time with someone local but not so with someone across the county.
Must be the social animal in me combined with that the preconceived notion that contact with someone local means in person.
If you really are “connected” in some way to someone, it should not matter how you connect, just that you do.
Lucas Rockwood (2012-12-02) #Feel the same way... lived in Spain for 3 years, feel like I just arrived. I don't know anyone except my staff, and only 1 is from here. Every day I leave the office and feel like I'm on holiday in a foreign city, it's really refreshing. People dismiss virtual and international/online friendships and connections as superficial, but often I find they are more meaningful as people come together for real interests not just because they happen to live next door.
Always enjoy your posts...

Tom Ortega (2012-12-02) #'Bout time you figured that out. ;)
Only question I have is what do you consider answering every email? Local or global? Could be local as its just one person, yet could be global as the distance between the two of ya could be huge. Just wondering.
Welcome back and look forward to seeing the rise in writing output.
Very good question. Going to address that soon. I'd like to make 1-on-1 emails more helpful to more people, perhaps by making them public with permission. We'll see.... -- Derek
TerryLee WHETSTONe (2012-12-02) #Web being rebuilt.
But, it is great to have you back and I know I have not written very often but love always what you have to say and share. You have a great soul and heart for us all to share with us.
Being a artist, musician, speaker, teacher, and story teller keeps me out there in the public. I did buy a home again and love to be able go there and be in my own world when I need it. Home is like the teaching of the Turtle, it is while you stop and can go into your own world. So, that home can be any where in the world at what ever time you think you need to stay there.
Again, we all are better for you being back. OstA Nuwati, Wa-do' and be safe and blessings always. TerryLee
Ryan (2012-12-02) #Excellent subject to ponder. My wife and I just moved from Dayton,OH to Seattle just because we could. Uprooted my local business and am starting that again here. Also in the middle of major global business projects. I'm trying to juggle keeping up on both of these and build new relationships out here. I think it can be done, but requires strategic planning and consistent action.
Larry Fishman (2012-12-02) #Great post.
One of many decisions we all make in creating our own life.  There is no right or wrong answer to these.  Only our quiet inner voice leading us down our path.  I'm glad you are listening to yours.
As many have said, Welcome back.  I'm enjoying the journey.
Mike Reynolds (2012-12-02) #I just came to this realization this week in a right brained sort of way. You've put words on it. I don't feel much connection with the music scene I live in and want my stuff to connect &amp;quot;out there&amp;quot; somewhere. I don't think you have to gig 50 weeks out of the year in your hometown anymore to have an audience.
Tor Valenza (2012-12-02) #Relate a lot to this post, Derek, especially having a career in writing and social media. I do believe there needs to be a balance, though, so welcome back to the cyber world! But remember to have some friends over once in a while.

Jim Smith (2012-12-02) #Derek, I picked up this post 90 minutes after it hit my mailbox, and I'm already comment #180+.  Wow, you have a lot of fans!
You really nailed the difference between local and global.  I love doing a bit of both, and I'm happy to know you're returning to a more global focus yourself.
I love all the comments in this stream that address the issue of balance -- and that it's different for everyone.  I still live in the same place I've always lived, and I consider myself a locavore when it comes to foodie culture, the arts, and shopping.  Yet I travel often, and I belong to several deliciously diverse global communities that have led to my working with clients from a couple dozen countries.  I absolutely adore working across cultures and seeing the many ways we are the same yet different, and making global connections, and seeing the world in different ways.  AND I like living where I live, as a home base.
It makes the world go round.

John D. Laskowski (2012-12-02) #Derek,
   Having traveled to many countries in my USN aircrew service ( 1967 - 71 ) I always had that yearning to return home. Nothing ever felt as good as central PA even though many of my visits to many of the wonderful spots on this Earth intrigued me.
   But things always change radically over time and my remembrance of the quaint identifiable contrasts of the  side by side streets in Singapore where ethnic differences were evident down to the marketplace smells have all but vanished with its modernization.               At the Raffles Hotel where as a novice traveler I ordered a &amp;quot;fried egg sandwich&amp;quot; for breakfast to realize the British equivalent was toast with the crust cut off layering sliced hard boiled eggs !
   One other recollection  in traveling was if I met someone from central PA I knew it as soon as they spoke a few words ! I could usually tell within a few miles of where they were born, raised, or resided for many years just by their Pennsylvania Dutch accent dialect. Our accents follow us no matter where we travel to and reside.
Thanks for the re - contact, Derek. Keep up your good work and deeds.
Linda Seabright (2012-12-02) #Derek I get it. I promote music and events in New Orleans but I live in San Anselmo, CA. It's all about where your heart connects.
AndreaGerak (2012-12-02) #So happy to have you back, Derek! Was missing your writings!
I can absolutely identify with what you are saying: having lived in 6 countries so far, I am planning my next destinations :-D
Fortunately now I also have the tools of how to be a perpetual traveler, which has always been a very appealing idea for me, but didn't know how to do it in a &amp;quot;professional&amp;quot; way.
And the concept that I was supposed to settle down someplace, because &amp;quot;that's how life goes&amp;quot;, only made me frustrated for long years.
The world is so wonderful and there is so many things to discover and experience!
However, my little homeland Hungary is still in my heart, and no matter where I go, I am always the happiest to return and meet my family, old friends and colleagues. Then, after a while the travel bug would bite again
Alberto Arias (2012-12-02) #Good article, Derek!
I tried to put our metal bands globally, but sometimes when the promoters and booking agents looks our rooths, they say:&amp;quot;Colombia, woah!, how can you do it?&amp;quot;
And, they forget us and they still attention to their local roster......
How we can solve this concept?
I don't know the booking world, but one guess is to provide them the convenience of being local: use Skype to get a local incoming phone number, call them from that, assure them you'll take care of everything and it'll be as easy as a local band.  Email me for more thoughts. -- Derek

Kevin Ross (2012-12-02) #Thank you Derek.
This may seem random, but have you asked yourself why?
Perhaps going back to the global perspective is just another shift, another way to search for fulfillment?  I've bumped into a few entrepreneurs, they seem to be on a trek to find meaning, exhausting all avenues and options (life, work, it doesn't matter).  This includes places to live.  I had a similar methodology until I had exhausted enough paths to finally understand that my fulfillment comes &amp;quot;from within not without&amp;quot;.  Since then, I have enjoyed a different but meaningful trek into some philosophy and deeper understanding of self.  I'm happy to share if you are interested.
My fulfillment definitely comes from within. My world travels are more of a “Why not?” - the way you'd read a book in your living room, then go sit in the bedroom for a while, then perhaps the back porch if it's a nice day.  It's a big world out there, so why not spend some time in it?  Not expecting it to make me happy.  I'm already happy. -- Derek

Andrew Atter (2012-12-02) #Hi Derek,
Great to hear from you! Local can be global if we spend time with people who are global in mindset. I get energy from spending time with people who can help me connect to bigger questions or themes. It is like the idea of a fractal...one person can illuminate a pattern that is present in the whole of humanity.

You may not remember me, but I interviewed you for a book I'm writing about people reinventing themselves...Anyway, thanks for always being a step ahead of most of us with your worldview. Also, it's so cool that you have a desire to &amp;quot;share what you learn.&amp;quot; Speaking of which, my husband and I both loved your book, &amp;quot;Anything You Want.&amp;quot; Do you have any other books in the works? If not, please consider writing another one soon. I bet a lot of people would love to read about your life in Sinapore and your desire to live on the other side of the world so you could &amp;quot;stop thinking of those people as the ones who live on the other side of the world.&amp;quot; Isn't that how you described it?? How global would that be? Please consider it...

Kristy Hanson (supplies) (2012-12-02) #Thanks for this, Derek! As a performing songwriter, I have struggled with this dilemma, but didn't quite recognize it until now. As much as I love playing live shows, I am very productive on my own, generally preferring to spend my time writing, recording, and releasing things online these days. This puts me more in the “global” camp, it would seem. I have worried that this tendency will hold me back, and I’ve spent a lot of time beating myself up about it. But your piece makes me feel that if I fully commit to my global focus, I might even be more productive and forge a new kind of path.
But just as tests for introversion/extroversion score you on a spectrum (and I happen to be almost right in the middle), I think the global/local focus exists on a spectrum as well - especially when it comes to the insider/outsider division you draw as a parallel. While I might have positive feelings towards my own family, church, or university community because of our common ground, that won’t necessarily make me a participant in cronyism or even mean that I will ultimately prefer “insiders” to “outsiders.” Being aware of or even celebrating your membership in a community does not mean that you will not venture outside its boundaries.

Michael D. Hall (2012-12-02) #Thinking globally still seems to have a little more sense of control. In our online worlds we can pick and chose a little more about who we engage and can move much more quickly through those digital relationships. With analog relationships it's a much slower process. We have to feel every person the old fashioned way, which to the digitally attuned mind can feel ponderous and exhausting. I'm trying to change the way I approach digital relationships by having one-on-one conversations with interesting people, recording and publishing them on http://UGtastic.com. Some are in-person which was analog and had a high cost of energy and time. Now I'm also interviewing people online which is much lower effort but lacks a certain intimacy. It's too soon for me to say exactly what is missing or gained through either format.
Derek, UGtastic is focused on understanding technical user (and maker) communities through an ongoing series of short interviews. I'd like to invite you to an online interview. The fastest way and the most control for you is http://bit.ly/ugtastic-interview-slots. I'd love a chance to chat with you about your experiences engaging communities worldwide.
Thanks,

Mike Roeder (2012-12-02) #Very interesting observation. I've been struggling with this on my music blog since I started it in 2006. Am I a local music blog, or am I a news/reviews/etc. for all music? I consider myself fairly versed in the goings on in the music world, but there are certainly other blogs that do a much better job than I do breaking news about the larger music world. I find when I focus locally I end up making a bigger impact than when I try to be one of many writers covering the latest news about some band or another.
I started out with the goal of just capturing my thoughts and interests in music in general, which I pretty much do. In recent years I've partnered with the local music venues in Eastern Iowa (who all need PR assistance) and started writing music reviews for a local independent music magazine. At the end of the day, I get a lot more feedback on my work locally than I do about anything else I work on.
I don't think I'll stop writing the articles with larger geographical implications as I see fit, but clearly I have drifted to a more local focus.
Thanks for the article! It has really helped me think about this topic I've struggled with for a while.

Bill Mentz (2012-12-02) #I have been on both ends of the spectrum. I played music on the road for many years, so I have connections all over the world. Then I spent 20 years in northern California raising two kids. I was almost totally local except for the emails and internet with the outside. I just got back from France and Spain for a family vacation and my thoughts are much like yours. I have a need to expand outward, start playing music again, and at 55 years old, go back out globally.

Paul McBride (2012-12-02) #Derek,
I would add private and public to local and global.  Maybe they are the same.  I've been a very private person for an awfully long time.  Reaching out is difficult for me.  I would much rather be &amp;quot;discovered&amp;quot; than to force my opinions and ideas on others.  In our society, because of the internet, and because of the myriad ideas found there nothing is private anymore, and discovery is only part of the process of interchanging ideas.  There are some things I have yet to share with the world, but when I try to make them global, I learn from the experience and those things become refined.  Sometimes I don't particularly like the refinement sometimes the refinement is a revelation.  Sharing ideas with other folks is something that is highly rewarding to me even more than monetary.  You have been doing a good thing there with your work.  Keep it up.
Thanks for asking,
Paul McBride

Steve Lover (2012-12-02) #Derek-
As always you serve us succulent food for thought.
I am giving my $.02 just to add a perspective.
Global becomes thought leaders.  It is their ideas that get bandied around, chewed up and discussed that impact society on many levels.
The implementation of those ideas is usually done by someone on the local level.  They might not be the idea generators, however, they are the ones that make things happen, thru their relationships, influence and drive.
As always, thanks for your insights.
Irene Konig (2012-12-02) #HI, I am older than you and have had to think about this issue every now and then. I use a combination approach. Because I don't have abundant energy or resources, I stay put in one place, near family and friends,but do my artwork and have it on the web, where people can see it, and benefit from it as well. I don't do a lot of face to face one on one interactions, although I do talk on the phone to special friends, and always make time to see my family usually once a week, for at least a few minutes.
I like to think I am helping my community by founding and running a neighborhood association. I like to think that I have helped a number of people directly and indirectly through my creation of art, which more often than not, has words conveying wisdom within the designs. I feel that the visual delight and the profundity of the words are equally valuble for learning to live in a good way through life. Many people don't consider certain aspects of life, or have not yet been exposed to them, and through my artwork, they do get exposure.
 I also write an email newsletter which I send out to several hundred people talking about my experiences through life, and also what I think about ideas that have come across my mind, and many people find inspiration through this, and tell me that they appreciate my doing it and sending it free to them. So I guess that I have gone both narrow and wide in my life and in my point of view. I feel everyone is good as long as you don't do something to make me think otherwise.
Colin Michael (2012-12-02) #In many ways, I'd love to get involved in whatever Derek does next, because I would like to be a part of his story. On the other hand, I'd love to make a great story of my own that rivals his. Trying to strike a balance between those two things would likely just confuse the heck out of me. And that's about how I feel about this question, too. I'm fairly quirky which is awkward in the local, personal sphere. Globally and impersonally being quirky is almost a necessity. I cant see a way to comfortably balance the two, fundamental world views.

Glenn R. Dickson (2012-12-02) #A few points.  I think if you have kids, staying local is preferable for them.  Strong roots and ties to local community are very powerful as you are growing up.  Second, environmentally, locally based living is way better for the most part.  Flying/driving around produces a huge amount of greenhouse gases.  We can't sustain the jet-set lifesyles.  Third, two years in a place and you have barely scratched the surface of what is going on there, really, especially if it is in a culture foreign to you.
Thanks, deep topic which deserves a lot of thought.

I have been permanently traveling for the past 2 years, mostly in South America. I make friends where ever I am and I keep in contact with people around the world. Where ever I am now is &amp;quot;home&amp;quot;. Whether that is a web-based community or the local hole in the wall veggie restaurant.
I think in 50 years we are going to look back at all the nation states and nationalism and wonder what were people thinking. We are all humans living on planet Earth. It really is one global village.
Happy Monday!
Michael
Mark Whitty (2012-12-02) #Hello Derek,
Cronyism!! Ha! Ha! I did a 5 day gig playing for a big computer &amp;quot;Services&amp;quot; company playing Xmas carols &amp;amp; jazz LIVE on the internet around the world. Think I sent it to you with video Derek. Best gig I ever had. Billeted with a movie star (former, no hanky panky). The company installed me on a site like Facebook and set up a website for me. I filled in my profile on it. The site contacted me &amp;amp; said I must enter my school record! I entered, &amp;quot;Hard Knocks&amp;quot; This was accepted! Ha1 Ha! Ha! Best regards from OZ. Cataract OP in Feb, no playing until that. Wish me luck. Mark &amp;amp; Isabel

Lynn Siprelle (2012-12-02) #This cracks me up.  We were online friends when you were in NYC, but I had no idea you'd moved to Portland until well after you'd left! Which is totally not an indictment; we'd lost touch. In the context of this post, though, I find it amusing.
All very good points.
Carmen Benitez (2012-12-02) #Wait just a second! You decided to go local in Singapore?! Tens of thousands of miles from your inherent global home in an environment that is ridiculously transient (hello little red dot country). I totally commend you for enjoying the nature of programming (virtual) but perhaps trying the local on true home turf would have been more meaningful. I mean upon arriving you arrived into an ecosphere where people &amp;quot;knew&amp;quot; you (really as the guy who built CDBaby and nothing more or less), so those hours were likely surrounded by people who care to only know that story and get entrepreneurial tips out of it. Nothing really local about that.
 I love Singapore and have had the great pleasure of appreciating my time here as well... 1) to build and think global and 2) to force myself to acclimate and think local -- even if I spend the majority of time away from the island (been outside SG for a month bc of work).
By the way-- I still carry in my workbag the poker chip you gave me. It's my way of being local and thinking global. Cheers!

You probably didn't know this about me, but I'm great friends with Sir. Paul McCartney.  Yes, THAT Paul McCartney.  I told him I knew you and he wanted to meet you.  I was sad to inform him that you no longer do in-person meetings.  Ah well.  =)
Interesting approach, as always with you Derek.

Ah well.    Thanks for the offer, though. -- Derek

Eddie Rhoades (2012-12-02) #Derek,
  So glad you are back as you are always a clear thinker of the big picture. It's good to see you have narrowed your focus down to what matters most to you which you have always been so sharing with the rest of us.
Sheryl Shumsky (2012-12-02) #I think you'd like Montana. (Altho' I'm currently in New Orleans, my brother back home reminds me - a musician can live anywhere.) Lately, it feels like our capacity to share has really ramped up and people are motivated towards it for meaning and purpose not to mention monetary gain. I can imagine Singapore was rather alienating - with it's lack of cupcakes.
Daniel Browning (2012-12-02) #A nice philosophical piece, Derek. When I was younger I was social and popular; but as I've grown older I've left the social scene in favor for internalizing and publishing globally. I don't really think in those terms though, except as a tool for putting an objective edge on my thinking. Like Marcus Aurelius I sometimes elevate myself to a high vantage point and view everything like an alien -- it's a good trick because you're able to get out of the egosphere and mind games and see how tenuous and fragile our relationships on this earth really are. I think maybe another name for the global vantage is selflessness, which to me is freedom.
Mike Carew (2012-12-02) #....somehow I get the feeling you always knew this. But like most of us we try other things just to see how it feels or goes -  there is always the chance it might be better.

Quentin Pain (2012-12-02) #This is so timely. I am in the process of writing a book and keep coming across that old marketing issue of segmenting. Do I write the book for a segment and make it easier to market, or write it for a global audience, which is what my gut is telling me to do.
You just helped me make up my mind. Thanks Derek.
Cookie Marenco (2012-12-02) #Great to have you back! I wondered what happened.
I, too, have been seduced by global customers and it's wonderful.  After 25 years with a commercial recording studio that catered to the local community, we now have a label where 75% of our customers are outside of the USA , and it's delightful.  2013 will mark the first year music sales not only surpass the studio, but support it.
You could say that we did the reverse of your journey... I started local (first as a piano teacher, then as a local performer, followed by 20 years as an engineer and producer/commercial studio).  Between working at  Windham Hill and Liquid Audio, I got the bug for global while my studio peeps ran the facility when I was out.... but outside of consulting, the studio always had the upper revenue hand until this last summer.
When we started the label 5 years ago, we swam both rivers local/global, to make the financial change to our global product economy.  I'm still a little overwhelmed that it's happening, but thrilled.
Solving one person's dream in the studio over months is rewarding, but solving 20,000 people's dreams with the release of one song in minutes is addictive.
I wish you the very best and look forward to hearing your adventures!
Judy Frankel (2012-12-02) #Local: I help people choose and plant fruit trees that work in our climate. I convinced my neighbor to buy a Lapins cherry tree that pollenizes my Royal Ranier cherry tree so long as they are less than 150 feet apart. Yesterday, I attended an event called Money Out Voters In where I met 15 people who volunteered to help me with my global endeavor.
Global: I run a website that is meant to fix Washington, and by extension, the world's problems, like global warming. These ideas are best handled from my lap: writing a book about my experiences trying to find the next POTUS, and emailing people who want to make a better world for their children to inherit.
We are all one. It almost doesn't matter whether we act globally or locally; all these intentions cycle around the globe.
Mark Narayn (2012-12-02) #A very interesting article Derek - and an impressively large following who have all commented very fast - so they must have you high on their list of interesting people (as I have!)
I think that local and global serve different purposes, and which you end up focusing on the most will depend upon the time in your life and your natural preferences.  The luck of where &amp;quot;local&amp;quot; is, and how much variety and depth of thought people you meet there have, makes a big difference.
It seems that the size of the global community will always contain more interesting people than a local one just because of its size.  But with the level of filtering that is required to work productively online, it is easy to end up missing a lot of it, and communitcating with those people who fundamentally agree with one's own views, and I see this as a big problem. I like having my ideas and thoughts challenged and love seeing different perspectives - but I have to make a conscious effort to maintain that, which I'm not always good at.
When I lived in London, my local community was big and varied enough to challenge the global, because the face-to-face aspect is (for me at least) far superior to remote communication. I don't know exactly why this is, but it's a bit like seeing a TV program on a place as opposed to physically being there. I love people and the interaction that comes from informal as well as focused dialogue.
Here in Norwich (where I now live), the community is much smaller (rather like Flint Michigan was, when I lived there in the early 60s) - much less diverse.  But it helps a lot that it is a very old city and also a University town, as that widens up the kinds of people I meet. I like local, as long as it's not too parochial, as my talents lie in working with people face-to-face (disruptive education).  However, online global contact with interesting people is a lifeline for me - although I'll endevour to eventually meet as many as I can!
On Friday, I was at the local gym, in the showers.  Another guy in there suddenly started loudly singing various old songs to himself. At the end as he was leaving he said to himself &amp;quot;singing is good for the soul&amp;quot; and he really meant it.  Despite me knowing this and having intellectualized it, this face-to-face, local experience had a far greater impact on my real understanding of the importance of singing, just for the sake of human expression, than anything I could have got remotely. It put a real-life side to why the last 100 years of passive TV watching and the &amp;quot;professionalisation&amp;quot; of the arts, needs to be eroded by the internet's Web2 culture.
I'm not suggesting that a local perspective is better than the global one (it isn't), I'm just trying to add a bit of balance and suggest that often many of the things we search for globally, already exist locally, if we look hard enough. Humanity is fantastic and everywhere - so I would go for &amp;quot;global&amp;quot; intellect and ideas, mixed with &amp;quot;local&amp;quot; humanity and community.
  great example. thank you. -- Derek

&amp;quot;The difference between teaching a class and writing a book, I guess.&amp;quot;
There is no difference between those two things. If you teach a class, and enlighten the students, you help them expand their minds. They then go out into the world and each creates ripples that may stretch all over the globe. If you write a book, it may be read by the person sitting next to you on the subway, and they might live in the apartment downstairs from you. You just never know how close, or how far your efforts to improve the world may extend.
For me, global is local, and vice versa, because we are all neighbors on an ever-shrinking planet.

Suzanne Brooks (2012-12-02) #Hi Derek:
Some time ago, I communicated with you about some ideas for women of color. At that time, there wasn't a good fit for you, though you were not unsupportive. I am now waiting for word of approval from a South American country and a global humanitarian foundation for major funding of a project with several divisions. When that happens, I would like to contact you directly about a possible related joint business venture. How can I do that privately?
Suzanne
(We first communicated when I let you know I had lived in Pullman and worked for WSU)
Cool! You (and anyone) can always email me directly, anyway. I reply to all.  That said, I can't do any new business ventures for the next few years until I've already finished what I've started with my own. -- Derek
Mary-Margaret Stratton (2012-12-02) #Thanks. Love it. Good timing. Answering you in the public forum with some personal updates.
I like that you have announced your choice. For now  Being local is very dependent on the actual locale. You simply may not be local to Singapore. Maybe you have not found your 'local' locale yet? Maybe you never will? Maybe you will? We don't know what we don't know.
Funny - I am heading to L.A. tonight to take the last of my things out of my apartment there. I always thought that was home, but my molecules have changed. While I will still maintain a presence in LA for work, we have made the commitment to move our personal items to Vegas (for now). We purchased the duplex across the street from our triplex and are setting up a new project. &amp;quot;WholeWay Home (not a halfway house)&amp;quot; which will serve as a sober-living, veggie friendly, artistic space, home-based educational gathering place for friends to stay long term or short term in a life affirming atmosphere. Yes, a local endeavor with a global consciousness, a new concept of commune, I suppose.
One of the precepts of the home’s consciousness shall be to commit to living in the present moment. I think that is a possible answer. Not to judge whether you are locally, globally or even internally orientation, but to be fully present to wherever you are at. If you are with others, it is in your best interests to be present to them. Conversely, when alone, to be fully oriented with yourself, and/or with the world in a cosmic sense. In general, my observations of the natural world suggest to take such a balanced and flexible approach.
Back to this past year... I have hosted several people at my home from across the globe, from a MBA student from Singapore to New Yorkers ‘n’ more, and now I have a New Zealander staying with me. I drove to Canada and back last year to explore the West of the Western hemisphere. (I must say I loved the vibe and farmer's market at Eugene OR, but I digress.) This past summer we took off two, too short, months and drove across the US to simply enjoy and explore the land, but also to find &amp;quot;home.&amp;quot; (And no we have not explored oversees yet – but it’s in the plans.) The question has kept creeping in for us. Where is home? Where are we ‘local?’
I do believe that while I loved every city we visited, like music, there were some places that held better harmonic resonance for us than others. While I like a little consonance now and then, to keep me on my toes, Solfeggio frequencies do exist. And I believe places have them, too, and that is where you will feel more locally-oriented. However, the higher you vibrate on this planet, the more refined your own particular frequency becomes and the more precise will your resonance requirements become.
So as of now, I know home is a place where I can be absolutely isolated or only connected to the world simply through the internet and one-to-many ratio. But as a Homo Sapiens Domesticus Fragilis, I still require some form of one-to-one interaction with community, if not for anything but pure survival. But I also enjoy recognizing the face of the cashier at my health food store, a smile, the eye contact, perhaps a shake of the hand. So I could not ever personally say I am oriented one way or the other, because it might limit who I am and who I can become.
So in the meantime, this past year I designed and built the 3d model for a future dream home/community center complex, but I have no idea even what continent it may be on? I almost feel that place that will fulfill my own resonance requirements does not yet exist. After traveling, I really became aware how cities are built and develop and see there is a grand opportunity for whole brand new cities to be created that express new ideas. (I have started to collect ideas for that and may hit you up for advice in the future.) But for now, I am going to be present where I am in the moment… writing to you and your fans on a global level, AND putting my theoretical ideas into practice in a local way.
Derek, it seems to me that we all just really need to focus on what’s right in front of us without the need to define it local or in other ways. You live where you live. You connect where you can connect. Technology is ephemeral and life moments are fleeting. Yes. We need to be aware, to discern, kithe and groc the choices we are making. But I am not sure it is necessary to define or put boxes around them. Too many isolating definitions and less focus on unifying connections. There is too much black and white, liberal vs. conservative, “us vs. them” thinking being promoted in the world these days. This all starts us down the road of judgment, even if we think we are just being intellectual, and not being judgmental. Who is to say the when night begins and day ends? Is it really it the point of sunrise or sunset?
What if you are jumping on a trampoline when the sun is setting?
So as far as your “being local experiment” has been concerned, when something didn’t feel right to you, it was simply an itch to get you to try something different (as you said, neither right or wrong). And knowing you – hopefully you will always be a very itchy guy! The irritant in the oyster makes the pearl.
Whether it’s local, global, universal, whatever, the bottom line is that the world will be a better place to have you focusing on writing and recording. I really hope this means music? I met you because of the “Hit Me” album. It was the first sight-unseen CD I ever bought off the internet. It is an excellent piece of musical art and I still listen to it. I always asked if you were gonna go back to writing. I am very thrilled and excited to hear what comes out of you next!
Stay itchy, my friend.
Will (2012-12-02) #How do you deal with isolation and loneliness? Somtimes I think about moving off into the woods and throwing myself into my music and projects, but I think I would start to go a little nuts even though I'm introverted.
Richard Hudson (2012-12-02) #Derek, you are a most creative person.  Your writings are always inspirational.  Thanks for sharing.
Elaine Stirling (2012-12-02) #Derek, I can't recall seeing a blog anywhere that receives 200+ comments in a day. You have the uncanny ability to create titles that push our tiniest buttons, the ones we wear to appear politically correct while hoping to maintain our non-conformity. Of course, I thought you were writing about vegetables, and who among us doesn't feel a twinge of guilt &amp;quot;buying global&amp;quot;, off-season?
Being a writer, I've always thought global b/c that's where sales are. On the other hand, my corporate clients in Toronto are the generous locals on whom I can test my latest ideas. Finding that balance is unutterably joyful, and you're living proof that the balance creates its own form of &amp;quot;local&amp;quot;, as in right here, right now--where all of us from everywhere are talking with you. Thank you for creating this ever-in-season neighbourhood.
Mary-Margaret Stratton (2012-12-02) #P.S.
I am not so sure that &amp;quot;Two hours spent being useful to one person who wants to “pick my brain” is being local? That just sounds like you were pic-pocketed energetically! All energy in any transaction should be balanced. I know it's out-of-date, but have you read Celestine Prophesy? There is some good stuff about energy thievery in it.
Hmm.... long time ago. Loved it then, maybe should re-read.  And yeah a lot of my Singapore interactions were very one-sided. Mentoring, advising, etc.  Some people are able to get something out of being a mentor, but now I know I don't enjoy it. -- Derek
Cam McNaughton (2012-12-02) #Hi Derek:
I wonder if freedom is where the comfort lies; lack of freedom, and discomfort slips in. Focus seems like the common ingredient in your discussion, as well, i.e., the potential contrast as between a local &amp;quot;focus&amp;quot;, versus a potential global &amp;quot;focus', is what you seem to be addressing.
So, if a local focus somehow impinges on the freedom to shift focus globally, say the attributes of whatever that local focus may be might not share well globally, for instance, a constraint perhaps kicks in; likewise, if a global focus somehow impinges on a potential local application, say, of that global focus being shared locally, yikes, another constraint gets experienced.
I'm wondering if the real test here is where does the freedom get experienced, which may well beg the question, what is freedom ?
Perhaps in any balanced equation the freedom, in this case to be on either side of the equal sign in the equation, is symbolized by the equal sign; so, when, one might ask, is one free to focus either locally or globally; or back and forth even ?
Perhaps, in that case, simply when one is able to operate focus freely ... which of course begs the question, what might impinge on the freedom of focus ...
I suppose there might be a hint there, i.e., things local, not sharable globally and things global, not sharable locally ... in each case, there might be a problem ...
The common denominator ... seems to be what's shareable both locally and globally ... for if it's shareable both locally and globally are you then where you want to be, i.e., free to focus in either way, local or global ...
Which, of course, might also beg the question ... is there a shareability index you might look to ... and of course, shareability, it's experienced uniquely locally, yet it's appeal, and in some ways, the litmus test for  shareability, may be the potential global application for unique local sharability ...
So many things are universal, yet always experienced uniquely, locally; grief for instance, as one example; but take your pick there; and iPhone expereince is universally available, yet uniquely experienced, via local use.
You meet people in person, in now moments; seems like shareability must occur in now moments, as well; it seems also, like your local focus versus global focus potential freedom quotient, if you like, that may well lie in some sort of shareability aspect of the focus involved ... for what does shareability represent ?
Well, I'l leave that up to you to answer ... it seems these are all Derek Sivers &amp;quot;like&amp;quot; ideas, in any case ... : - )
Yet, a good question to ask along the way in life, might be, what impinges, versus what helps along, shareability; also, what's worth sharing ...
Some might say, useful things ... some might say, the valued experience, that could well arise in those now moments ... the factors behind usefulness and valued experiences are many ... a litmus test, though, might be ... what's their shareability ... : - )
And what's better shared than usefulness and the generation of valued experience ... in focus, both locally and globally ?
Lauren (2012-12-02) #I enjoy my small circle of friends but I have also made a great many friends online that I have never met, yet still expect to be friends with perhaps forever.

Jim McQuaid (2012-12-02) #Useful thought and wonderful comments, observations, and qualifications.
My concern is that not all skills sets / aspirations readily work as &amp;quot;global&amp;quot; efforts. While the Internet is helping, there are still many artists who yearn to reach a wider audience;  but it doesn't happen easily. And, being willing to give your work away for free helps reach an audience but obviously is unsustainable for most people.
Michal Jirků (2012-12-02) #Hi Derek,
Thanks for the article. It puts into words something I've been mulling over for some time.
I think one of the problems of &amp;quot;global-only&amp;quot; people when dealing with locals is the low amplification.
When I was the president of a local Toastmaster club here in Brno, I got a chance (for a year) to lead a club of 30+ interesting people. I like to think I helped to develop some of them and that maybe I inspired others. And I sure enjoyed the ride immensely and made friends. But it always bugged me that the amplification was so low.
When I write a piece of code, patch a bug or hack up an article, virtually anyone can benefit from it. And google analytics tells me, that some people do. Years after I did that particular thing.
If I contrast that with &amp;quot;local&amp;quot; work I did in Toastmasters, I'm sad to say it just doesn't compare.
And I suspect it's like this for virtually anyone whose work is predominantly digital.
I've never understood big conferences and user groups, because (at least in Czech Republic) it was usually a bunch of guys sitting in a room, talking about semi-interesting things, and just waiting for the day/event to be over just so they can sit in a pub and &amp;quot;socialize&amp;quot;.
I don't mean to disrespect anyone (to each its own), but that always felt like a time suboptimally spent.
I guess I'm also &amp;quot;global&amp;quot;, then. Thanks for putting it into words better than I could.

Kelly Rafuse (2012-12-02) #Derek,
Once again you've inspired me out of the blue when I needed it most!  I'm surprised somewhat to learn you are quite introverted, which is why when you &amp;quot;extraverted&amp;quot; by socializing and saying yes to every request your creative output ceased.  You need to replenish that well with solitude!  I've been studying up on personality types lately.  I am blessed/cursed with the INFP type, and I am coming to terms with it and learning to honor it, finally, about 20 years later than I needed to!  My career in corporate radio was moderately successful, but only because I extraverted myself every single day, leaving me little energy for anything else.  Eventually I became drained and miserable.  And my career didn't take off the way it could have because I just didn't have it in me to be that kind of social game-player!  Thanks, again, for sharing a well-timed piece of your creativity.  It's helping me in my latest reinvention.
By the way, there is nothing wrong with the millions of natural Extroverts.  Their contribution to the world is through all that socialization.  If it wasn't for my extroverted husband and friends I'd probably go months without speaking to anyone lol!  I believe in a Creative Force and that we've been given our natural personality types for a reason.  And that we are all contributors of the Divine Spark to the world.
 Yeah. I'm very much an INTJ. -- Derek
Bill (2012-12-02) #Well put.  I spend perhaps 3 months of &amp;quot;spare&amp;quot; time working on promotion for a music festival in PA, while working in IT 40-50 hours a week.  I'd REALLY like to get them in a money making mode, but frankly that is a bit of a problem: the festival is in the &amp;quot;middle of nowhere&amp;quot; --- with a semi-limited audience.  When I offered a 1 hour video of a couple of the festivals to PA Public Television: no response.  Silence.
Such is life.  I'd love to figure a way to do recording work outside the area, but that is very difficult given the need for a real pay check the rest of the time.

Mary Maddux (2012-12-02) #Great to hear from you, Derek, and especially with this post that echoes my experience so beautifully. A relatively small number of people in my town are interested in my work, so not only is it not economically viable for me to stay local, it isn't nearly as rewarding as reaching thousands of people globally who benefit from what I do. Even the currently politically correct idea to &amp;quot;buy local&amp;quot; feels too constricting to me. I like the freedom of letting connections happen where they naturally and spontaneously do, be they economic or otherwise. I don't feel a global focus is better than a local, it is simply more natural, practical and fulfilling for me.
Chuck Buchanan (2012-12-02) #It seems to me there is value in making such decisions consciously.
Steven Cravis (2012-12-02) #Thanks for this great article, Derek. Such an interesting point that I've never read or considered before your version here, yet I relate so highly to the difference between local and global that you're describing. Back when I was in Junior High, I was introverted, yet the only way I knew to be social was to gain attention from classmates by gathering them around the piano (at the school) and learning all their requests: &amp;quot;Play 'Riders on the Storm!&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;Play 'Beth'!&amp;quot; I didn't realize until now, that this was when I was developing my global preference because I was headed toward composing music for global distribution, which now is my full focus. Sometimes I'll attend the ocassional party, but am often thinking highly about how much I want to really be composing more music, or improving upon my web sites' effectiveness to generate more sales of my music. I lack presence at those social events, but I suppose I have to learn to accept that about myself. Thanks again.

Manda (2012-12-02) #Derek, it's good to hear your philosophy to the group again  ~ they do feel like two different mindsets and I enjoy switching between the two. Acting locally can send global shock waves of good out there and acting globally can effect individuals...I find it fascinating to try both and given how technology has sewn us together from across the world, it feels like other countries are just the town next door...we're looking forward to your next inventions.
Barry Shephard (2012-12-02) #It is nice to help and keep in touch with people around the world, youtube, face book twitter etc. But, virtual friends that exist in cyber space are no match for the real thing. I have tried it too on a smaller scale.  Cyber space somehow de-humanises humanity while connecting strangers from around the world. But, the felling of meeting a few real live human friends is what humanity is all about. Have a few close friends not 400 who know your heart and soul. (Being local), and, use your cyber space for connecting the world of lost and found strangers. Keep a balance. Do not lose what is in front of you. If you look across the sea you miss what is in your own backyard.
Tim Ferguson (2012-12-03) #Thank you Derek. Your work has been a great help to many of us and your thoughts are greatly appreciated. As a CDbaby and hostbaby user I have benefited, and continue to benefit, personally from your innovations. Those two projects have simplified the life of many freelance musicians like me. While I am of the mind that you can find a balance between local and global, selfishly I am grateful that you are returning to your global efforts.  I look forward to your next project and always enjoy your posts.
Joe Leonard (2012-12-03) #Nicely done. I have a similar philosophy about brain power. You have a finite amount of it. How are you going to spend it? Playing video games? Writing a book? Surfing the web? Learning jazz piano? Whatever you decide to spend your brain power capital on means there is something else you can't spend it on. So choose wisely and if possible have a vision to guide it. That is basically what creativity is, making a vision real. Joe.

Christobel (2012-12-03) #Well said Derek!   I've noticed that very thing.....being local and one to one is really exhausting.   I guess everyone needs to find a balance.  As I get more experienced, more people want a piece of me and your blog has made me realise that I need to start get some resources out globally for some sanity.  I love the fact that you are free to travel the world.

Matt Taylor (2012-12-03) #Derek,
Excellent article and thank you for sharing this. Has eloped me to understand better my own inner struggle. I have deep feelings for where I grew up (NZ) but have always felt at 'home' elsewhere. When my kids visit I feel torn to go back. My balance is that I'm local with my exercise doing yoga in small local yoga club, I like to sit with locals at a tea shop and discuss local events. I also participate in local charity work. My work is focused on products for AsiaPac and the world (I'm a product manager). My private project with my son is working on creating disaster relief system to be used worldwide.  I feel engaged when I have discussions, online and off, with people from around the world. When I disconnect from the rest of the world, then after a week or so, I feel like there is a void of some sort, an intangible uncomfortableness that seems to come from not having me reach out beyond my local confines and not having people from around the world touch my mind.
Bottom line is what I feel,do and think is definitely global for my project, projects and 'big plans', yet local when it comes to 'being present'.
Keep writing, as Seth said, we need you.
Jon Kotinek (2012-12-03) #I recognize the drained feeling you described because that's what I feel after any interpersonal interaction. As a classic introvert, I get my energy from time alone (as opposed to a classic extrovert who would be energized by the interaction). I think your observation about the need for both local and global development might interact in an interesting way with that basic kind of distinction, because it seems to me that local interaction is almost always personal.
The hard part for me is that I feel acutely that the emphasis on shrinking the world and what can be done is resulting in a generation that doesn't know how to do anything locally. I've become very interested in fostering things locally as a consequence: food, business, music, art, community. This focus is draining because I'd rather not have to do all the personal interaction, but want to be able to enjoy a rich local culture. I suppose that this might be an *ahem* local pr

India Holden (2012-12-03) #Well, interesting. At first I though the subject matter of this article is not quite of interest to me. After reading some of the comments and your responses, I am getting something out of it after all.
Until now, I've been teaching classes on peer-counseling and  am developing a class that teaches wholeness through the practice of unconditional love. I'm writing a book on the latter, so, I do have a local and global aspect. That said, I've been wondering for a long time why I am, even though I'm ecstatic while I teach, never satisfied the next day. As a result of your post and the ensuing dialogue, I get it now. I'm simply not satisfied with the local reach.
I am keenly aware that if I taught on the global level I would make a much bigger difference. I don't want to be ungrateful for the opportunity to make a difference in one person's life, but perhaps, after reading your post, I can begin to feel that it's OK, rather than neglectful or hubris, to want to work globally.
Thanks, Derek. Just the other day I was remembering you, thinking &amp;quot;What happened?&amp;quot; I'm grateful to have you back and the benefit to me that that represents ;-)
Jon Kotinek (2012-12-03) #...problem and not something you'd have to deal with in a more cosmopolitan place.
This piece also made me think of another of your articles that I'm fond of sharing: the one where you talk about finding and focusing on a niche. That strikes me as an incredibly local impulse, but your 1% audience might be spread all over the world.
Anyhow, glad that we can expect to see more from you!
Kelly Pardekooper (2012-12-03) #I love this Derek! I feel I've somehow been on this journey with you. I put my first CD out on CD Baby in 1998.  Since then...I've recorded six more albums, toured all over the world and lived in Iowa City, Madison, Nashville, Los Angeles and now Indianapolis. I love all these places. Had I not &amp;quot;done my time&amp;quot; in LA I wouldn't have connected to my music publisher who has placed my songs in True Blood, Sons of Anarchy, Cold Case, Blue Bloods etc. I don't mention this to brag, I mention it because had I not been willing to leave my beloved Iowa City hometown I would have felt stifled. I think we are all on our own musical path to happiness and I'll always be thrilled to hear about where your path is taking you. Good luck with what's next and keep us posted!

I'm a homebody at heart and still involved in UMM and the community of 2500 people that I live in. I have a project studio and record local musicians for the most part. I keep in contact with people who have moved away via Facebook and each year take a couple trips down to Mass to visit with family. I take a trip abroad once year also.

Burton (2012-12-03) #Derek,
Everything you wrote was about giving, and giving the max. Being global allows you to give more.  It's that simple.
So it doesn't seem like the issue is if you're local or not.  And let's face it, it's so damn obvious you're a &amp;quot;Giver&amp;quot; - there's &amp;quot;Givers&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Takers&amp;quot;, obviously.
So giving is really important to you, and you've figured out how you prefer to do it.
For most people, daily friendships, getting out of the house is &amp;quot;Local&amp;quot;. Maybe you travel and get around so much, that you don't hang-out locally. Or maybe you're all about your work, and not getting out of the house is just fine with you.
So ... obviously you &amp;quot;give globally.&amp;quot;  Question is, do you hang out locally? Do you even want to?
B
Yes! Exactly. Thank you for putting it succinctly. -- Derek
Janice Kephart (2012-12-03) #My children make me local, but my mind works globally.  My work is global.  My music seeks to be global as well.  Some of my best friends I've met only because I go global perpetually.
In the end, it is about (1) what we love; (2) where we are comfortable; (3) and what makes us feel most productive.  I feel most productive when I affect the most change, in hearts, minds, policies of our government.  I love what uplifts my soul.  I am comfortable in my own surroundings, even if I can make myself comfortable many places.
My work love is global.  My person love is also local.  Kinda like Bill Clinton, except ... not.
Michael Christian (2012-12-03) #Here is a twist on your conceit.  I think there are four available quadrants:  Inner local, inner global, outer local, and outer global.  I will give some personal examples.  As a child, I lived an extremely inner, local life.  The intimate life of the mind was terribly important to me and it consumed much of my thought and energy.  That seems to have come about partly because of my petit mal epilepsy.  (For an account of that see https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cXd9YQOlFZ6UGdnuJl32PKe6OD06HNypNKRqaWqgJyA/edit .)  I was often unavailable to the outer local and, of course, the outer global.  And the inner global was mostly unavailable to me, because I did not have access to the centuries-long conversation of recorded human thought.  As I began to read, the inner global planted a seed that grew.  I found friends, enemies, and tour guides of the mind in books.
By the time I reached college, the inner global became a wild party in my head.  Scientists, novelists, poets, and philosophers were making loud noises there.  As an intellectual with no audience, even my writings were inner global.  That might, in fact, define academics as opposed the the broader category, &amp;quot;intellectual.&amp;quot;  Very few of them really have an audience or any influence.  The exceptions can be quite grand though, and they are intellectuals first and academics second.
Then I traveled and studied abroad.  This ironically re-enforced my inner global and inspired my outer local self.  My inner global self began to consume architecture, for example, as part of the life of the mind.  And I engaged with people and places intimately, directly, and one-on-one.
Next I went through a long phase of outer global.  I call that work.  I was plugged into business and technology endeavors that had global effect.  I was rewarding financially and, in for me a pale, weak way, personally.
Finally, in early semi-retirement my life is mostly outer local.  I am back to my original home town attending to friends and family.  My most outer-global product is wine.
Perhaps when I publish my book I'll take it on a tour and go very outer-global again.
Jeff Goins (2012-12-03) #I can relate to this. Sometimes, I feel bad for how disengaged I am locally. This gives me comfort in not feeling quite so weird about my passion for creating things for the whole world.
That said, it does seem important to have some sense of local/familial connection to keep myself grounded. Do you have anything like this, Derek? A community of people who hold you accountable and love you / call you out when you need it?
Absolutely. They're just not in one place. My best friends are phone-friends (we see eachother rarely) and it's been this way since I was a teenager. Works for me.   -- Derek
Jude Aher (2012-12-03) #as a poet from the usa civil rights &amp;amp; vietnam war 60&amp;quot;s I found that to create art one must connect with the universe where it shows itself.  sometimes within an indiviual as sometimes with starving children in africia as the need to feed the fight for civil rights within my so called free country.  i create as art calls to me.  so i must not over focus on either side of our world.  but i'm an artist.  i create for the soul of the universe in a world that doesn't believe in poet's anymore.

Ricky Kendall (2012-12-03) #Derek, I wish you had gotten to know the people in Portland, Oregon. I lived there from 1980 to 1995. The people there are wonderful and extremely close knit for such a large community. Music and the arts in Portland are some of the best and the community supports both wholeheartedly. I left in 1995, after losing my 13 yr partner to AIDS. I cut my CD, Crayon, with the proceeds from the sale of my home and moved to Sedona, Arizona, another awesome place. I guess I'm not very global but I find that reaching out globally has a cost, not so much in time but in dollars. I gave everything for my CD and am very proud of the work. Dollars, however, never made it my way so I stay local, now is Las Vegas, with my chin to the grindstone. I'm glad I took the plunge, with my CD, but the pool was dry.
Agreed! I later moved back to Portland for a year and met a lot of people, and love Portland. I come from 6 generations of Oregonians. There's a street named after my grandfather, and all my family is still there. I'm old-school Portland, baby.   -- Derek
Cliff West &amp;amp; Pops (2012-12-03) #As usual, Derek your sharings are insightful, purposeful and helpful.  I especially gravitate to your comment stating that 'Both are necessary'.  One of the primary quests in our lives is that of being comfortable in our own skin while pursuing the calling which has been placed within our hearts. How that is achieved is a work in progress process for all of us.  In today's world, it definitely pays to invest our time on a global scale for sharing our gifts.  However, there is that quality interaction which only that 'local' contact can provide. It serves to ripen and complete us even as we share our bounties with the world.
Stay in touch...I'm just glad to hear from you again...you're just that kind of person

Leanne Regalla (2012-12-03) #Yeah, what Seth said!  ;)
I have also always been more globally focused than local. I studied languages, got a Master's in International Business, and then ended up a musician &amp;amp; blogger.
Although I do hang and have local friends, my best friends are scattered all over. My dream is to build my platform so that I can 1) help people achieve their creative dreams and 2) travel and share my music with anyone, anywhere who's interested.
Welcome back!

Paul Micich (2012-12-03) #Thanks for the insight. It's great that you point out the different approaches so clearly.
My version is a little different. I illustrated an edition of a book that sold 1.5 million copies. I managed to negotiate creative control of what I did, but any business was completely hands-off for me except for some signings. The advance and royalties were great for my business, but connection with an audience was a kind of strange disconnected experience.
I'm also a musician. I have a band that plays my original world music inspired instrumental music. My most lucrative kinds of gigs are street level at art fairs and events like that where I can sell CDs. It's great to connect with folks that way. They come upon us and vote for us by plunking down $15 for something they weren't aware of before. But out of earshot we pretty much don't exist.
I keep looking for a happy medium between a corporate arms-length connection to a big audience and a street level experience. It's good to have another way to frame. Thanks-
Trance Blackman (2012-12-03) #thanks, Derek. always insightful and rewarding.

Aldo Castañeda (2012-12-03) #Derek,
I'm not certain that I entirely buy the notion that one has to make a choice. For example, I started my little company through which I sell a product online. That part is already surprisingly global. At the same time my suppliers are mostly (not all) local. So I'm increasingly tied to them on a local level. So am I local or global. It feels like my business is both. But it is early, I just launched two months ago, with time perhaps it will naturally lean local or global. I'd
...i write the &amp;quot;Think Globally, Act Locally&amp;quot; mantra has sprung up. Perhaps there are ways that we can &amp;quot;architect&amp;quot; our businesses to embody both to greater or lesser extent.
Your work is thought provoking as always. Thank you.

Landa LaMotta (2012-12-03) #Hi Derek--
I totally &amp;quot;get&amp;quot; what you're saying.  I've always been a global person.  And, while learning to be more local was a challenge, I've found that incorporating some local into my global comfort zone has been the most rewarding and fulfilling.  So I won't just pat you on the back on your decision to stop speaking, etc.  Instead, I'll remind you that Stephen King, who writes a good story, spends most of his time writing.  But he also sprinkles in some speaking engagements, music gigs, media appearances, etc.  Now most of the media is tied to promoting his product, but I think the others are more self-satisfying.
So Derek, I'll challenge you to pick over the 400 or so opportunities you've had these two years to find the top five most rewarding.  And those, my friend, should point you toward the local engagements you should keep.
As for me, a new endeavor is almost ready to hatch, so I look forward to sharing my news with you in the near future.
Cheers!

Patrick Dacre (2012-12-03) #This concept of connection is inconsistent with reality, when one considers that each Moment(core word for momentum) is fleeting when contexted with past or future. The Present is a gift, and this suggestion that any place is home(where the heart is) has an olden basis. No society in history has placed so much misplaced emphasis on 'location..location..etc' as the 20th century.
For me, and perhaps the rest, the idea of being a spiritual bedouin is the new 21st cent survival technique.
Drop the global gig. &amp;quot;This is an illusion&amp;quot;. Focus on the immediate NOW(power of Now) and be in the gift called the present.

Interesting points and like has already been mentioned, balance is hard to achieve. Humans are too complex to be either / or we need to act along  a continuum depending on our life stages and experiences.
David Shelton for Utah Green (2012-12-03) #The fact that I feel I must think about things before speaking has isolated me from most groups.  I simply cannot work myself up to the level of mindless chatter that seems to be the current norm when more than two people are together.  I also feel like an alien in their midst, since I am not in accord or interested in shallow chatter, so I hesitate to speak, because, from experience, if I do, in most cases I will identify myself as someone not in accord with the sentiments of the group, and that makes others feel uncomfortable, as if I'm watching and judging them negatively, although that is not the case.  I find people very interesting, and would like to join in, but I haven't the verbal skill, or perhaps the courage, to adequately express myself, and it doesn't help that not being in accord makes me nervous about expressing my ideas, which are almost invariably shot down and ignored.
There is a type of conversation I can actually function with a group in, and it is called Goetheian listening.  The rule is that if someone is expressing his ideas, the others listen carefully and try to empathize with what is being said, and not let every phrase cause some knee jerk response to spring up in one's consciousness.  One must make an effort to connect and identify with the speaker on a purely human level.
When the speaker is finished, there is a thoughtful pause, after which another individual may speak.  One finds that one can truly get to know others on a soul level this way.  To me, this is far superior than everyone trying to talk at once, and rapidly chattering about sports and popular culture.  There is a time and place for this, but I fear most people have no other sort of communication with others available to them.

Jen (2012-12-03) #I don't know that the issue is really &amp;quot;global&amp;quot; vs &amp;quot;local&amp;quot;. It's a choice about the way you distribute your energy. It's between a &amp;quot;vague cloud of thousands of people&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;people I know and work with one-on-one&amp;quot;.
If you have a global mindset, putting energy into products used by many, you can affect many people at once. But you can feel disconnected from the people who benefit from your work. If you distribute your energy locally, you're seeing the effect of your work on individual people, which can be gratifying, but exhausting.
I used to work in a hospital blood bank, where every bit of the work I did affected someone's health care directly. I was getting blood ready for surgical patients and cancer patients, and dispatching uncrossmatched blood to the ER for trauma cases. It was extremely fulfilling work, but it was too much stress, too much pressure, so I quit. I work in manufacturing now, making products that techs use in blood banks in order to do the testing that saves lives. Each thing I do now affects more people, but I feel disconnected from the process. Neither extreme works for me.
That's why I think that like anything else, it's really about striking a balance and finding a way to do a little of both without killing yourself in the process.

A local economy is needed more than ever! Bioregional economies vs making more stuff, and having to ship it everywhere makes no sense. Where global can really count is via the internet via apps and other programming etc.. but making more stuff and shipping it everywhere days are over.
Vernam Cipher (2012-12-03) #Pre-Internet, this discussion might have been &amp;quot;social&amp;quot; vs. &amp;quot;anti-social.&amp;quot;  :^)  The web opened a world of possibilities for some of us who might not be into local networking.  But now we get to consider ourselves &amp;quot;uber-social,&amp;quot; or global in Derek's terminology.  For musicians who haven't broken through globally (or at least nationally or even regionally), then gigging locally is the only option.  But putting energy and resources into global action definitely comes at a local cost, as Derek experienced.  And vice versa, spending time working the local network definitely entails missed broader opportunities.  Local people (at least where I live!) aren't adequately impressed by things that might garner broader attention.  And the things that would lead to more and higher-paying local gigs are most certainly not consistent with getting broader attention.  So . . . someone in that situation might think about moving, but what if that isn't an option due to family commitments?
Cam McNaughton (2012-12-03) #Yes, Burton zeroed on that &amp;quot;giving&amp;quot; factor above; a giveability, you seem to have lots of, Derek; well done : - )
Still think there's a shareability factor there; one that applies both locally and globally, i.e., that there might well be a shareability factor to things, one that helps determine what's useful, as well.
Trees that bear good fruit, the shareability is inherent, in the fruit; actions that bear fruit, perhaps the usefulness there is measured, by way of fruitfulness.
If your focus is on what's potentially useful, well, that's good; usefulness, most likely that's always shareable; choosing to share what might have found to be useful, though, that's an important step not always taken ...
Thanks for your ponderings ... and for sharing those.
All the best, as you go global again ...

Regarding the article, as well as my next project, I take a different position (I actually agree with many things said, but I think of may have missed a few points). Think back to when you first had the idea for CD Baby, before it was CD Baby, who helped you cultivate and test the ideas? I wasn't there but I believe from your audio book I listened to it was local people. Local friends, local band-mates, etc.
My next project is called ChamberX, I am attempting to create a service for local Chamber-of-commerce organization throughout the US. Why, because there aren't any decent services provider to my knowledge, and also because it occurred to me recently when I sat down to think about how I could grow my business &amp;quot;and build lasting relationships&amp;quot; that I had completely ignored the opportunities (business and otherwise) that were/are right in-front of me.
I agree that there is no right or wrong perspective, some people prefer intimate settings where others prefer to be exposed. (big churches versus little churches comes to mind for some reason)
Anyway, great article.

Bruce R. Gilson (2012-12-03) #I don't think I'm wholly either local or global. I've been writing books, thanks to the wonders of print-on-demand, that can be read by anyone worldwide, and I have online friends from places like England. Yet, my day, when I'm away from the computer, is spent at local stores and restaurants; there are things I won't buy online because of shipping costs, and of course I can't eat online, so for these activities I interact with places in my county or the adjacent District of Columbia, pretty much exclusively.
Art Szabo (2012-12-03) #I was wondering what happened to you! Glad to hear from you. I to have recently come to this conclusion and have moved from edmonton to Kelowna. Although still buying for the Starlite room in edmonton, I have moved to this little slice of paradise to concentrate on my management and design business. I am managing 12 bands and all are doing well and 2013 is looking like a banner year! Thanks for the inspiration and guidance.
Jenica Rayne (2012-12-03) #Thanks for the update Derek, your words and insight come at just the right time, as I am making my move from local to global.
David Griffith (2012-12-03) #I stopped writing songs when I had nothing left to say. It’s not a writers block - it’s more that there’s nothing left demanding to burst through. Perhaps, the songs weren’t that ‘good’. Perhaps there’s more to come.
Resources, or the lack of them, helped to give me an option of playing locally or not playing publically at all. It’s quite useful sometimes to have an ‘either or’ choice.
In my early sixties and having written all my songs using only chords, I discovered Griff  Hamlin’s 4 note blues on the web.
Suddenly a wave of delight washes through me as the realisation hits that I actually have four fingers and perhaps the ‘iron cast’ limitation that I’d placed on myself decades ago and which roughly translates as “I could never do that.” was replaced with “Why can’t I do that?”
Two years go by and I’m playing music without needing words. It’s slow - which is fine - and ‘Apply yourself’ is the cheerful directive that Griff gave me then and which still rings true.
So I go quiet and leave my songs and my local public playing and follow my internal prompt which is to develop music rather than words.
Most who come here would be locally creative in one way or another and all of us are now able to reach globally with our words.
I’m not sure where I’m going with this but it’s related to the probable truth that you, Derek, started cdbaby and then hostbaby as a way of getting your music ‘out there.’
No offence intended - I don’t listen to a lot of music and wouldn’t search you out for it yet your articles always resonate and nourish and thus are always welcome.
Intentional or not, it’s your thoughts rather than your songs to which I gravitate. The internet allows for instant global from born local.
Les Visible is another author/musician/songwriter who posts wonderful and very human articles and whose words resonate without me also wanting to hum his songs while pottering about the kitchen.
So our thoughts and songs are born internally, expressed locally, given wings to fly globally ...... or not. Locally, globally - ripples on a pond from a pebble embraced.
All along the way, being true to oneself.
Heard a wonderful talk from Alan Watts while writing one day. Got very serious with my thoughts and stopped to pause and think about  eating at precisely the time that his recorded voice said “Ah shut up and eat your doughnut.” ..... upon which moment we both burst out laughing.
Paul Collins (2012-12-03) #Hi Derek!

Heath Molton (2012-12-03) #I agree, Im not Local either. It seems all of us Musicians start out local, but are always pushing to not be local, as in, playing more gigs in different states, different countries etc....
I know plenty of local bands, and they are happy with what they are doing, good for them, but for me it has always been about pushing the boundaries, taking Local to a new level, being a Local band Nationwide. Its not an easy task, but really nothing worth having ever is.
Phil Tripp (2012-12-03) #Good to hear back from you.  It's now been two years since I retired from my global position in the music industry and semi-retired to a house overlooking the ocean surrounded in a horseshoe of mountains.
Instead of growing businesses, I'm planting peppers and other fruits or vegetables and am locked into this cool community of Coffs Harbour where I know a lot of people (unlike living in Newtown in the centre of Sydney) have great friends and do things that are not about creating or exploiting content.
It's a wonderful life to get away from living the corporate nightmare and embracing the dream.   Hope you get closer to the vortex.

Rene Kwan (2012-12-03) #Nice to hear from you again Derek, yes i'ts been awhile that you went silent and suddenly there you go again spreading and sharing your positive thoughts to everyone.  I believed you are just born to be a model, and i'ts really wonderful to have a kind of people like you, and I am just one of those following your path and philosophy in life.
Myself is retiring soon, and will be moving back to the Philippines somewhere in a quite place but along the beach. But nonetheless, this never means, I give up in life but actually I am pretty active and distributing my own CD album (3 CD album) globally aside from making   a couple of bucks in my Royalty (CCLI). Once I settled in that secluded place, I will start to establish my own website for the download of my music globally, so thanks for your very enlightening ideas and for being a positive attitude. God bless you Derek!....and lastly, you are still welcome to come and see me in my hiding place which of course enjoy a - &amp;quot;white sand Island&amp;quot;, go for snorkeling, fishing or scuba diving. By this 2013, I am permanently retire there but also will come back to Canada as they requires.
Chris Gray (2012-12-03) #That's the beauty of what the internet has brought us. Global *is* local and vice versa. I'm as connected to some people on the other side of the world as much or moreso as 'locals.' Your community is what you create and participate in. Global or local, the only difference is the street (or IP) address.
Jim Taggart (2012-12-03) #As much as I agree, Derek, given that my blog is read on five continents, I believe in the GLOCO concept: think global, act local. That's guided me for many, many years, and as I head towards 60 in less than three years, I'm finding new volunteer work in my community.
I never lose sight of the bigger picture, but each of us are a mere human being, borrowing time on this planet for a few nano-seconds. Make a difference in your community.
Danial Moore (2012-12-03) #Hi Derek,
Long time no chat.  Two thoughts come to mind when reviewing your post.
1) My first thought is that there is a definite need for both local and global operations in any given market.  And like you, my prefer operating globally.
2) My second thought is that this post has quickly become a link referral page as well.  As such, I too have obliged and added a link for anyone that regularly sends or receives money in foreign currencies.  It may not help much with SEO, but could certainly help with networking.
Anyway, thanks for the notice and welcome back to the global market.
Jackie Britton Lopatin (2012-12-03) #I tend to agree with Rob Roper's post #43. You need to achieve a balance in your life, particularly since you now have a family. In your article I heard you talking about writing, programming, and recording things. I didn't hear you saying anything about your music. And that's sad. My husband's a classically trained flutist as well as a flute maker and he's learned the hard way that music isn't just something he likes to do, it's something he NEEDS to do. So he now belongs to a community orchestra and gets full-spectrum musical sound waves on his body on a weekly basis. For him, it's the equivalent of belonging to a church with music, laughter and caring friends all rolled up in one. And it's cheap therapy. The rest of the week he works hard in and on his business, both at his workbench and online, but the music feeds his soul. It's also pointless to make the kind of flutes he always wanted to play while neglecting his playing skills. Also, he's found that most of his non-profit work has led to paying work or sales, one way or another. It helps on many different levels.
If you're still considering your Muckwork concept, check out the Neat Office scanner concept. You may find that one investment like this may help your musician/business customers a lot. Pushing a receipt or business card through a scanner is easier than either typing it in yourself or hiring someone to do this kind of scutwork. So far, I like it.
I AM glad that you'll be publishing more online; I've missed hearing your thoughts.
Roxanne Agredano (2012-12-03) #Derek, I'm so glad that this is the decision you have made.  I totally get it and I missed your posts.

Morgan Howard (2012-12-03) #I'm not sure about your premise of being either &amp;quot;Local or Global&amp;quot;.  As a Tlingit, a large part of our identity is &amp;quot;where we are from and were our family is from&amp;quot;.  We considered ourselves &amp;quot;place-based&amp;quot; people.  Part of being location-based probably has a lot to do with community.  However, as Tlingits we also have an established relationship with our environment as well.
We're definitely more mobile as people than we were a few hundred years ago but is this better?
Ben Casnocha recently talked about how &amp;quot;the loneliness he sees deep in the eyes of people who declare themselves “nomadic”.
Maybe you're just an introvert and your &amp;quot;community&amp;quot; happens to be folks found around the globe.  Either way you're part of a community... which I believe is necessary for happiness.
Zuke (2012-12-03) #&amp;quot;If you’re a musician, you can do 100 gigs or write and record 100 songs...Different focus. Different approach...Both are necessary. Neither is right or wrong, but you need to be aware of the choices you’re making.&amp;quot;
My students are constantly asking me how they should shape their future in music and I always reply that there is no road map.  The road you take is yours alone and it is the right choice.
Good post, thanks!
Drew Warner (2012-12-03) #What I took from it: &amp;quot;Both are necessary. Neither is right or wrong, but you need to be aware of the choices you’re making.&amp;quot;
Thought provoking is what this post was supposed to be. When I take a look I think you can do either very effectively or both in a balanced way depending on your industry.
My wife and I own a fair trade organic chocolate company called Just Good Chocolate. Between ingredients and packaging we source from Peru, Paraguay, Dominican Republic, California, New Mexico, Canada, Maine, Ohio and our home state of Michigan. I can't help but think of the effect even our small business has on jobs and commerce in each of these places. Soon it will be much more.
Yesterday,(Saturday) we served hot chocolate to a group of around 500 folks at a European style cross country 5k event, supporting local. The same is true of many events we attend, promoting a locally manufactured product with a  global supply chain to a local audience. At the same time we're starting conversations with Whole Foods.
Our intention is also to travel and form direct relationships with those who farm the cacao we use (Peru), the sugar we use (Paraguay) and the chocolate we use (Domincan Republic). It so happens we have 5 kiddos in house so although our ambitions are high (we've traveled a fair amount between us), the reality is that only time will tell where things lead.
Eventually I can see us running a local business, active in our community - yet traveling and contributing to something larger than ourselves. I'm not sure it will be the effect that a major software might have, but I do think it can be powerful and have a global impact. I think balance is achievable but I do agree that focus is really important to make difference in one distinct area.
After I read your book I shot you a note via email. The fact that you responded in a day means you're not the average Joe - wait, actually it means that you are. Excited to read more.

Mark Gresham (2012-12-03) #As recently as 2004, in and article for NewMusicBox I urgded composers to &amp;quot;compose (create) locally, market globally&amp;quot;: http://www.newmusicbox.org/articles/View-from-Atlanta-Compose-Locally-Market-Globally/
Today we are even more &amp;quot;everywhere at once&amp;quot; rather than just one place, though we may physically reside in one place while our &amp;quot;virtual nervous system&amp;quot; spans the globe.  (Yes, we could also be globe-trotting with Regus offices and the like around the world, if we have the financial resources to do so.)
But were it not for my connections to the internet during the &amp;quot;green text  on black screen era&amp;quot; my music would simply not have reached as far as it has, and had it not done that the almost no one locally would have cared.  (&amp;quot;It must be better if it's from somewhere else!&amp;quot;)
So perhaps John Cage and Marshall McLuhan were right about our developing collective central nervous system.  So was Joe Bankoff:
&amp;quot;If you’re 10 years old and your world consists of five blocks around your house or housing project and where you go to elementary school, your sense of the world is pretty limited. If you’re an immigrant or a second generation of parents who did immigrate, you’re also in an environment in which there are 12 other languages spoken in your middle school — which exists in DeKalb County — then you find all of a sudden that there’s a broader world. And if you’ve had the benefit of travel, if you’ve had the benefit of the opportunity to live in a different culture for a period of time, if you’ve learned to speak another language well enough that you can think in it, then you begin to understand that the human condition is pretty universal.&amp;quot;
(From part two of my interview of Joe earlier this year: http://www.artsatl.com/2012/07/artsatl-qa-part-two-joe-bankoff-midtown-generation-arts-leadership/ )
Travel is one way to &amp;quot;go&amp;quot; somewhere, fast-as-light communication is another.  In terms of having global impact, you can add &amp;quot;sending&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;receiving&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;going.&amp;quot;
I've been beginning to think that my [music] publishing is a &amp;quot;logistics&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;facilitation&amp;quot; business as much as anything.  Globally, of course!
Cheers!

Peggy Atwood (2012-12-03) #Derek - Great post, thanks for making the distinction so conscious.  You left Woodstock just as I moved up here, it was a sad thing to see you go. I was raised globally and always felt guilty for not being more community oriented, but as you said, it is exhausting and it does not work for me except for immediate needs.  I finally came to peace with it by just knowing that one must do what is right themselves; the world will truly be better off for it.  Do what you want to do, you have helped so many people, do not worry about it; we'll have your back.
Sebastian Marshall (2012-12-03) #Fascinating, I'm glad I've got a term for this now.
I think the local still matters though... there's a certain pace and rhythm to different cities. Even in head-down-and-work mode, Beijing is much different than Bangkok is much different than NYC is much different than Stockholm. Finding the right pace/rhythym for whatever global project you're working is crucial locally. I'm not so active in the Taipei local scene, but it's a perfect backdrop for global projects.
Yeoh Siew Hoon (2012-12-03) #Going by Pico Iyer, who wrote “The Global Soul”, you are also a “nowherian” – a citizen of nowhere.
“A physical location is unimportant so long as you live among values and assumptions that strike you as your own – or the ones you’d like to learn” and “home lies in the things you carry with you everywhere and not the ones that tie you down”.

Fanny (2012-12-03) #Thanks Derek, for the insightful and truthful article - something which all entrepreneurs faced but yet very few mentors/discussion boards/articles spoke about. It is currently an issue we we facing. We want to be global. But nurturing global relationships and businesses take time. In order to generate swifter revenue streams, we have been looking at the local markets. Demand has been increasing but that takes our focus away from the global markets. It seems like a vicious cycle now.

Derek M. (2012-12-03) #I always appreciate your comments, Derek. I am curious why you aren't living in Iceland - it sounds exotic and with a great community - all the Nordic and Scandinavian countries are socially more advanced though they are also cold!  I've visited Sweden and Denmark but haven't been to Iceland.  Even if you are a global person it is nice to live in a friendly environment with artistic leanings.  Alternatively, Singapore strikes me as a politically totalitarian place with great but very humid weather that is entrepreneur, international business and tax friendly but doesn't have sufficient artistic sensibility that would be necessary for someone like you. (I've never been to Singapore and perhaps am way off in my assessment.)  I know your wife has family there so perhaps that was a strong consideration.

On an unrelated subject:  may I please rant about somethink?

Elton Lee (2012-12-03) #Hey Derek, great article here! I love the first 3 words of this line &amp;quot;Both are necessary. Neither is right or wrong, but you need to be aware of the choices you’re making.&amp;quot;
In a sense, I agree that I have to make a conscious choice to focus on global or local to drive results. Yet I also believe there is a need for a balance maybe 80:20 or 90:10. Hence both are necessary is true in more than one way.
A need for balance stems from my realisation that sometimes, doing something unrelated helps me take a step back, take a pause &amp;amp; create new ideas that help me in what I'm currently focusing at.
Nonetheless, I can't wait to see you unveil your new creation. I'm certain that something really amazing will come out of a very focused effort from someone like you. Have fun!

matthew (2012-12-03) #hey derek!
vacationing aside, life was all pretty much local not too many decades ago, going back centuries from there. amazing stuff.
it's mind-blowing to think about how exponential change has become since electricity, flight, the computer, networks, etc. trying to imagine, say, 1901 is just something else.
and yet, the more things change, the more they stay the same. the greatest thoughts were recorded about 2,000 years ago on scrolls and parchments.
truly our connected world opens such opportunities - creating incredible wealth, and enabling the kind of global dichotomy you've ruminated upon.
there are lots of positives to it, but in terms of local community, i think it's really gone downhill, at least in the states. pop culture as a large subset of the online world has caused the proliferation of subcultural phenoms formerly unheard of outside of large urban centers. take peopleofwalmart.com for a frighteningly palpable example of this...but not too close to bedtime.
anyway, glad to hear more from you going forward, derek.
we're pondering a move to my wife's home country of ecuador, not sure when yet. but even that's a great example of the global phenom, that i use fb to keep in touch with friends back to childhood and up to locals, and if we move, i know i'll keep in touch online easily enough. it kind of lessens the impact of moving i think. and keeps good friendships alive.
take care.

Lori Crandall (2012-12-03) #I am a woman of the world.  I'll always be home in the USA, but I've lived in NZ for 11 years and Scotland for 1.5 years.  I cannot live a life that does not include the &amp;quot;globe&amp;quot;.  My mind is wide open now.
Stephen Edun (2012-12-03) #Maybe you already answered this but can you not do both.  Your a music guy how did Bob Marley pull it off. global superstar, but as local as you can get in tune with what happening in his yard as he was anywhere in the world. But I guess every musician and producer wish they knew the answer to that and how to recreate it. But look forward to hearing more from you. 
Moragh C (2012-12-03) #Welcome back, Derek.
You say &amp;quot;My best friends have always been people I met in-person&amp;quot;. That's so for me too. I have a lot of e-mail friends and I make it a point, wherever possible, to meet them face-to-face, no matter which side of 'the pond' they live.
I have met probably at least three quarters, and maybe more, of my e-mail friends at least once. Some won't ever be more than acquaintances, but others have become good friends. Of the latter, there are a few who have become particularly close friends.
I also have a good many friends both in my home town, and elsewhere in the UK, some of whom can't even use a computer, let alone have an e-mail address. I always enjoy meeting people face-to-face ... and talking to them on the phone when we are too far apart to meet often.
Hopefully I will get to meet you one day ... if you ever stay still long enough for me to catch you . Please let me know if you are ever planning on coming to live in the UK ... or even staying here awhile.
Cheers, Moragh
PS.  I hope my book goes global .

Estarmir Hernandez (2012-12-03) #Welcome back(?)
This article rings true to me. Especially since so many wonderful people (such as yourself,) have provided so much valuable content online. Real actionable material. If you were to only provide content locally, I would have missed all this online goodness altogether.
Thanks.
Hong Teck (2012-12-03) #I'm in Singapore and that means I have no chance to meet you one to one. :-p
Love your move. Likely you'll benefit more peeps the way you decided to do it now on.
Don Shetterly (2012-12-03) #Way too many generalizations for me.
I have moved and lived all over this country - okay, you've got me beat on the world stage.  Up until I moved to Florida, I had never lived in one place more than a couple of years.  I'm still getting used to this current concept means.
I'm not a member of a church, school, etc. or whatever else it is that I'm supposed to be.  I only keep in limited touch with a couple of college friends, one of which was also a coworker, but that's about it.  So the connections didn't really happen there either like the generalizations assume they should.
What I always found is that if I get involved doing something I love, that's where my connections tend to come out of.  However, it doesn't mean that they are work/project related - it just gives me the launching board.
I took a class at a local spiritual center and met someone in there that was just going there to spend time with her son.  We ended up being good friends.  Now, I've gotten to know her family.   Spent time with them camping, going on a casino cruise boat and watching a Nasa rocket launch.
Oh, and I went to a Nasa Tweetup with 150 other participants to watch the launch of the Grail Moon mission and ended up a few very good friends and connections out of that.
I just keep putting myself out there in situations that I enjoy in my community and let the connections work themselves out in whatever way, shape or form they are meant to be.  I wouldn't want to be put in one box or another anyway because I'd just tear the box down and design one that fit for me (without walls of course).
Community and connections is what you make of it - or what each of us individually makes of it.  In today's world with the internet, that means something entirely different than it once did.
Gary Heckard (2012-12-03) #Very timely thoughts.  Thanks for sharing them Derek.
To my experience, a COSMOPOLITAN mindset has very little to do with whether or not one spends most of the year on tour or on the web or playing a regular gig at a single club in only one town or teaching in just one place.  It has more to do with how one regards human beings broadly- with having a circle of concern that extends beyond the obvious which is close to oneself, but to encompass the valuation of all humanity.
I emphasize the word COSMOPOLITAN because it is easy to confuse engagement in international business, traveling around on airplanes and spending time on the internet as being a &amp;quot;global&amp;quot; sort of person.  One can do these sorts of things and be a cosmopolitan, and one can also do these sorts of things and yet be very provincial.  Multinational and multicultural adventures do not, in and of themselves, constitute a &amp;quot;global&amp;quot; sort of thinking.
Your projects, Derek, have served humanity deeply on a &amp;quot;global&amp;quot; level because they have helped to build bridges for ideas, which has fostered the bringing of people together in the right way.  It is unfortunate that many in the corporate and financial world extend the local vs. global dichotomy so far as to the idea that all globalized business action that operates according to Western defined capitalistic or free-market principles is self justified by the false belief that those principles are rooted in a single underlying &amp;quot;global&amp;quot; thinking.  Such aren't really &amp;quot;global&amp;quot; thinking, but are actually very provincial.
Time spent having real face to face interaction with persons in local settings is not provincialism.  One can dwell in a very localized place, and think very globally.  This is how most social progress movements were born (the abolition of slavery, the fight for suffrage, the civil rights movement. etc.).
On a sadder note, in this age of cyberspace many people are using technological tools in an unhealthy way that is turning them away from each other as real human beings, isolating them and making them less intimate with anyone locally or globally.  We see this tendency most profoundly in our geographical neighbors and the people that we interact with on a daily basis in our local communities.  They are increasingly becoming strangers to us.
I'm not thinking this was quite the point that you were making about solitude in your article.  But I mention it because it seems that many who have posted comments here have taken your article as a license to be more in that sort of way.
Mary Alldredge (2012-12-03) #I am just glad that you are back, my friend.  I have missed you and your wisdom.
Drew Barnes (2012-12-03) #Awesome!
Derek you have provided me with at least a something of an answer to a question that has truly concerned me for sometime. As a musician and recording artist I am far more focused on the global community in an effort to build an audience, and deliver my music to people who will find enjoyment from it. While I continue to play in the local Metro Vancouver Canada area, my fan base is growing internationally, while I am able to keep my chops up with the local performances. What I am excited about are the 1000's of music lovers around the world who have told me they find joy in listening to my music, and the endless possibilities that this indicates to me. Having begun my music career pre-internet, I was frustrated at not be able to expand beyond the local market, due to financial and time constraints. Now with the internet, that has all changed, and I am continuing to grow, find meaning in making music, and feel vital after almost 30 years as a singer/songwriter!
Nelle Thomas (2012-12-03) #Thanks for this insightful post, Derek! Reading through some of the comments, I see that this issue touches many of us. As someone who has spent the last few years trying to come to terms with my global-ness (does it mean that I'm abandoning home and the people there?), it's comforting to hear that I'm not alone.
I really like that you expressed your choice to be global-focused in terms of &amp;quot;usefulness&amp;quot;. I had never articulated it that way to myself, but I think it's a very fundamental human feeling: we all want to feel useful.
I have been at my permanent residence (in Quebec, Canada, in a nearly entirely French-speaking community) for the last four months, which is the longest that I've spent here in 4 years. My recently released debut album is in English, which has been a real roadblock to getting local exposure. Although I have been making an effort to embrace the local scene, I have found it really disheartening to receive virtually no support from the channels that ordinarily are quite supportive of local talent, because my songs are in English. I feel extraordinarily useless here, where I haven't been able to even have the possibility of exposing my music to audiences, to find out whether or not they want to become fans.
So, yes, I am also admitting to myself that I find it more rewarding to be global-focused! I am so grateful for my community of international friends and for the possibility of spreading my music on an international scale, not being limited by the parameters of my local situation.
Here's to usefulness!
Gen Berthault (2012-12-03) #Oh good! We are all on a journey and you are something like an intellectual GPS.
 Sometimes I've been surprised at where I have felt at home. If we are attentive to how we feel, setting out can teach us a great deal about ourselves that we might not learn otherwise. I have respected your absence but am frankly happy to hear you might start sharing your thoughts again.
Jennifer Hamady (2012-12-03) #&amp;quot;But something never felt right. After a day of talking, I was often exhausted and unfulfilled. Two hours spent being useful to one person who wants to “pick my brain” is two hours I’d rather spend making something that could be useful to the whole world (including that one person).&amp;quot;
Well said, Derek.  Thanks for this great article.  Much appreciated.  As always, you have me thinking.  ; )
Jennifer
Chrisg (2012-12-03) #Thanks for posting one-of-a-kind ideas like this and the last one. I like HSBC's slogan &amp;quot;The world's local bank,&amp;quot; and somehow you're the &amp;quot;world's local man&amp;quot; lol. But you're right, it would be more productive doing the same thing you used to be doing. That's what made you successful in the first place, being global. And that's the path I want to take too.
Ian Clay (2012-12-03) #Im keeping the dream alive, since we last spoke I've learnt both C# and objective C and still making money from music and now a bit of R&amp;amp;D with app ideas with my brother who lives in the USA (I live on the Isle of Wight, UK). Not working, but playing. I write code in a local cafe, at a table in the corner. And sometimes not at all. The best thing that happened this week was watching a heron on the river at sunset.
peace my friend, good to hear from you.
Chris Kirkland (2012-12-03) #Just the notion that we can contemplate leaving our locality and be global is very new on the human time scale.
Socially at least, it's pretty clear that we're hard wired to be local (from hundreds of thousands of years of living in small groups), so people like us who move around globally, are in relatively unchartered territory.
The modern world is vastly different from the world in which the small groups of humans existed, so the insider/outsider mentality is arguably out of date, and we're just waiting for evolution to catch up.
But of course it hasn't caught up just yet, and we're left in a global world still with rather a local mindset.
Certainly in my own social experience from moving around a lot I sometimes feel I lack a group of really close friends, since I'm diluted across a number of groups around the world (I'm well over Dunbar's number).
I've certainly gained far more in experience and opening my mind by moving around and being &amp;quot;global&amp;quot; than I've lost in relationships and comfort had I stayed &amp;quot;local&amp;quot;.  And as you mention Derek, one (you) might be more useful to the world working on a book to publish to the world rather than being a local teacher.
But I suspect it's not a simple black and white distinction, it's maybe that we're striving to find a new balance which isn't described by either &amp;quot;local&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;global&amp;quot;.
p.s. I wonder why you chose the title &amp;quot;You don't have to be local&amp;quot;?
Reminds me of the pressure coming from one's &amp;quot;local&amp;quot; group to keep you on the inside.
Martin Wolff (2012-12-03) #Thanks for your reflections, Derek. I also looked at your 10-second bio, etc and found it interesting that your favorite fable is also one of my very favorites, as well - though we probably couldn't seem more different, personality-wise!
I certainly have no idea how I, personally,  could help the world and yet my lowly CD on CDBaby reaches just the people (in different parts of the world!) that it is supposed to reach and nourishes them. I thank you for helping me to fulfill that role.
Devon Joy (2012-12-03) #I am glad you found your creative and personal and global home, Derek.  The Iceland house has lots of space and openness.
I imagine most of us responding are contributing locally or globally in hundreds of different ways.  What I loved about your book was your keen way of tuning into yourself; it was a reminder for me to continue to do this in my own life.
I am introverted by nature, work one on one as a therapist with lots of people who are more extroverted, and work in and impact larger systems, educational, health, and government.  So there is an exchange, a bit like jazz improvisation, if one looks for a musical metaphor.  And I really appreciate that introversion is having its day in the sun, so to speak.  Susan Cain's book, “Quiet”, has been on the best seller list for about 6 months now.
Phillip Glass has a way of saying it musically, that he listens and listens and finally hears what is already there.  He needs his solitude too, in order to be creative.
Patrizia Antonicelli (2012-12-03) #Hi Derek, you certainly get a lot of comments!
As for Local v. Global, I always thought of myself as a convinced global person, which I was/am. Since I moved to the small town of  Santa Fe I enjoyed doing what you did in Singapore, and still like it.  But I realized that I really get excited when I meet a &amp;quot;global&amp;quot; person.
At the end I think that it's kind of useless this debate! You do what you feel like a good idea, then change, and follow the opposite direction. This is what makes life interesting, I always welcome challenges!
Evangeline (2012-12-03) #Oh my god, you have no idea how reassuring it is to read this!    My husband and I have just committed to our career as musicians, but we're not &amp;quot;local&amp;quot; either, and that runs contrary to what people tell you to do!  You're supposed to play the scene in your area, be out making connections and all that stuff, but we're just really bad at that.  We don't care that much on a local level (that really sounds horrible to me, but it *is* true);  we've always looked at things more globally.  Playing 100 gigs sounds really stressful, but writing and recording 100 songs sounds really doable and fun.  Thanks for this.  We were honestly just talking about this just today... where our focus needed to be.   I know it shouldn't be polarized, but knowing where your own tendencies are is super useful.
Ruth (2012-12-03) #Phew! I thought it was only me who feels drained after being &amp;quot;peopled&amp;quot; all day (or sometimes for just an hour or two). I much prefer working alone while working globally, rather than interacting face-to-face.
And it seems I'm not as &amp;quot;unique&amp;quot; (I keep tell myself I'm not weird, I'm unique) as I thought. I always watch in wonder when I see large, loud groups of people together. I wonder how they can stand it.
Josh Hogard (2012-12-03) #I really think it's more effective to communicate globally. Crafting for the ether forces you to consolidate, to curate, to make a one-size-fits-some-really-well product or service, knowing there are varied solitary persons wherever it ends up. But speaking locally, however intimate and engaging, gives you room to be messy, to meander, because we can always repeat ourselves with more interesting amendments.
Steve Shuholm (2012-12-03) #Thanks Derek.
Great insight.  I see a little of a leverage point as well.
David William (2012-12-03) #Ah Derek, you've been missed. Just yesterday I told myself to drop you a line of encouragement because your friends around the world miss you.
It seems to me that you are a global local. Your local environment is this whole world, because youve always made your business part of the unique world/ community that is in the web.
It is no doubt fatiguing for you to be a local in the physical world because of your success in the larger locale that is the web. People want a lot from you because of the scope you've managed to create in your former 'community'.
Ultimately, your efforts go a lot further when you're larger than local... But then again, you're in a unique spot. Remember, not just anyone gets over 400 comments immediately after one blog post.
Like it or not, this is your local community.
Rose Costello (2012-12-03) #Interesting.  Enjoy the comments/discussion, too.
I've been reading &amp;quot;Quiet:  The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking&amp;quot; by Susan Cain.  Fascinating.  It reveals how extroverted our world tends to be and how devastating that can be if there are not enough introverts for the creative, thought-full (my word), and real decision-making needs.  Most CEO's are introverts.  Most MBA's are extroverts and schools encourage that.  And politics, well, look how Obama got shot down for being slow and thoughtful in the first debate.
I'm only on chapter 3....but highly recommend it!
You enjoy your solitude, and yea, that may be exactly what helps you be the creative, globally thinking person you have crafted yourself to be.  People run into walls trying to be extroverts when they're really introverts with so much to offer.  The world needs to once again honor these traits.
That's not to say global means introvert and so on, but your article speaks of your introverted ways....obviously a good thing!
I have to agree with Mathew, number 140, about local sources.  Food is a huge issue right now, and global doesn't work there.  Local is necessary, even in a global sense.
At the same time, wherever a person lives I think it's important to support the local businesses that provide a way of life for you.  So there's the balance as you work and create globally you are ABLE to support the local economy just by being there--not to say that you should become involved there, though, if that's not your creative genious; it would only stir up dirt.  And, like camping, leaving a place a little better than you found it supports both local and global--and ecological--worlds.
Great food for thought!  Glad you're back.  ☺  What will be next....?
Dr.Mani (2012-12-03) #Derek, I felt this conflict way back, and resolved it after an analysis pretty much like yours.  Online, as a writer/fund-raiser, I'm global.  Offline, as a pediatric heart surgeon, I'm hyper-local. (Lang Elliott in #17 above hit the nail on the head! Andrew Kolpakov had me nodding at #148 as well.)
I also wonder (after reading some comments) - What if your one-to-one interaction RESULTED in a 'global' impact?  Would it qualify as 'local' - or, by extension, 'global'?
Jack Vrooman (2012-12-03) #local vs global? or is it...
giving vs making
non-profit vs profit
selfless vs selfish
focus vs motivation?
you're such as sweetheart you'll grow whatever you plant yourself. godspeed.
Elizabeth Dyer (2012-12-03) #I have to say that this is an area where I have no clear focus. I work both for local people and for the globe. I have become aware of where/how I spend my time and try to determine and limit the local events to those that are truly useful and beneficial to me both immediately and long-term. It is, like so many things in life, hard to find the right balance.
Your article has given me a lot to think about!
John D'Angelo (2012-12-03) #Derek,
When I was in broadcasting I was definitely not local. Since I retired 12 years ago, I have moved out of the city into a village and have become local, doing volunteering work at local organizations, visiting local restaurants, using local services and donating to local charities. There's room in the world for either type, it just depends on what floats your boat! I do read the Times each morning and watch the BBC at night, so I'm still in touch with the world, but local is where I hang my hat.
Merry Christmas and happy holidays to all.
Alphonse (2012-12-03) #Hey Derek,
Great to see You back doing what you do best! Many of us are learning from your example because you're in a position that you could have just kept doing what you were doing and been perfectly fine, however you ventured out into the unknown and truly discovered what works best for you.
Thou your post was about time commitment locally or globally, I see it more of a &amp;quot;Desired Lifestyle&amp;quot; to work/create and live as you please. Now I got more stuff to think about going into the New Year. Thanks a lot Big D!!!
RK Dhanvada (2012-12-03) #Derek, You not only reinforced to what we all knew but did not observe of the subtle change happening in our business and social life circles. I was more connected with world across than those in my neighbourhood. Now no need to carry the guilt of being &amp;quot;in-sociable&amp;quot; or rather indifferent  in the local community when it is indeed not viable . Those days were different before the internet era commenced. There were  no choices. Net is such a level player to be resourceful be from Hyderabad or Houston.
You made us think and experiencing a feel good factor.
Greg Sullivan (2012-12-03) #Hi Derek, I had been thinking about this when trying to articulate my life's purpose. I want to add harmony to others music. I want to help people see what they can achieve and then support them to get there. This I do personally, to relatively few people but go deep. When I spoke to others whose purpose was to change the world, or help a country, I reflected as to whether I was being ambitious enough. In the end it is a personal choice for us to take, just imagine if everyone could do something great in a small or a large way... what a world!
Ryan Chilcote (2012-12-03) #I'm both local and global, but not with the same business.  I teach guitar at a local college and local music store.  There are days where I teach 9.5 hours with only a lunch break in between.  It is both exhausting and inspiring at the same time.   Then there is writing/recording and selling online.  The two actually feed off each other; I get students because of my project, and I get fans because I teach (which is not as powerful as the global thing).  I may start teaching via skype, so it may start to become global.  So again, I expect the two businesses to help each other there.  I feel I need both...to connect personally (local) and to expand (global).  I know you said one or the other, but for me I just need both
Flemming Behrend (2012-12-03) #Hi Derek
I think you are the only web person who's thoughts I ever read and take serious. You were the one who inspired me to become a musician who did something no one else did, so I became a &amp;quot;Danish Troubadour&amp;quot; and entertain Scandinavian emigrants here in the States. I like your article, but I also think that if we (as I did) grow up in Europe, it is impossible not to feel a bit tribal about everything in life. I burn for the Scandinavians because I am Danish. I don't give a hoot about Croatia or India for example! I do think you can be a bit of both. I have heard about some german musician who suddenly became famous in China. Go figure. I like that thought, but my energy will always first of all burn for my tribal brothers and sisters. But thanks, you made me think about it :0)
Mark Megill (2012-12-03) #Derek - I feel the same as David.  You have been missed.  It's because of you I've had the fortune to get to hookup with the likes of Melissa Forbes.  Now how is that? Someone in the middle of the USA get to hear 'Black Coffee/Brown Sugar' from Melissa from down under?  Global market and the majors couldn't have done that for her or me.
Glad your back!

David Sherbow (2012-12-03) #At times it's important to be local so you can figure out who you are and what you want so that when you are global people will understand what it is that you represent.
Emo LeBlanc (2012-12-03) #Derek, thank for making me realize I AM GLOBAL
Dale (2012-12-03) #As you say, neither is right or wrong but I think we all have a dream we want to realize, or we hope to evolve in some fashion to be better people.  Often being local means responding to the immediate physical and emotional demands that others place on our time.  Someone like Mother Teresa might argue it is the higher calling.  But to those of us who are not Mother Teresa, such devotion to the often petty and draining day-to-day can derail dreams or otherwise be an obstacle to becoming the person we want to be or the person we are satisfied with inside.  The answer is probably somewhere in the middle.
Mary Ann Hurst (2012-12-03) #Great thoughts that align with mine. I was brought up in several countries and continued to live a peripatetic life until recently when I've begun caring for my parents, who are in their 90s. The great thing about having travelled the world is that when you find yourself feeling &amp;quot;too local&amp;quot; your mind can take you to the many places you've been, knowing that life in those places is going on as well, as are the many lives you've met throughout life. Phones and email keep us all connected in a great way.
Jim Zachar (2012-12-03) #Great thoughts Derek! My problem was that I was in a local band. The city and out lying areas thought the world of us and always filled our shows. Globally we never made it but always had that unique distinction of being locally famous. I'm sure that I would have lived in that town till I died even if we would have become global giants, but it may have tarnished my view of what I thought was a great little city. I guess spending my time now writing and recording music for my own enjoyment is cool in itself as being locally or globally noticed has run its course.
Rebecca Barker (2012-12-03) #Nice to see that someone else struggles with things like this too - I am an introvert as well and I am passionate about progressive causes worldwide. It's a challenge to participate in all of the causes I care about and keep my eyes open to the epic span of history as it unfolds every day and to do what I can to affect positive change. I read somewhere years ago that USA citizens and our peer countries have a lot more influence in world just based on the weight of government processes, and I've taken that to heart ever since. I've lived a very different life and the huge gap between what locals are concerned about, and what I am concerned about - are two very different things, and it shows, my priorities are global too. There are so many different scenes in any culture it's very easy to get lost in the hype or remembering that we're all in one ocean and air, and not just a stream or lake.
Ken Davis (2012-12-03) #Derek, your achievements with CD Baby,  allowed you great influence and you are a great ambassador for music in the realms of Bob Geldof and even greater as you are a high intellect individual. The only way we can stop much of the Human Suffering is being a global composer creating music for change of consciousness . Global is the only way to be in this amazing technology world where our music can transform peoples lives for the better -  Go Global - Ken Davis - Music
Lee Cutelle (2012-12-03) #Years ago I was always thinking about going global but that idea seemed to be out of reach for me due to financial reasons. Then suddenly music on the internet came along and that changed everything. I still do some things locally but nothing beats the thrill of finding out  that someone from another country has purchased one of your songs from either CD Baby or iTunes
Matt Kress (2012-12-03) #Derek,
Love this article. It helps me realize that I don't need to feel bad for not socializing as much here in Chiang Mai while I work on my global opportunity to help others.
I've always had people ask about who locally I was meeting and interacting with and it made me feel bad like I had an obligation to do so.
It sounds like you've been battling with outside pressure as well and you've made your decision. Great decision to be yourself and do what you want!

Chuck Cliff (2012-12-03) #Excellent, for me, timing - just came to conclusions parallel to yours.
I enjoy playing songs in public and regularly go to the local singer/songwriter scenes here in Denmark - but am more comfortable with a living room or, actually, a (quiet) street corner - like applause, of course, but find it a bit of a bummer to concentrate on getting applause, prefer much more a bit of feed back on what the text and music evoke.
Kind regards,
Cliff

Come back to Portland
For a long time I thought that I needed recognition globally but I never felt content when I pushed for that. Now that I focus entirely on Portland's jazz scene, I feel part of a very cool community of musicians. Happy now.
Good to hear from you,

I lived in Singapore when I was in 3rd grade. I haven't been back, but I'm sure it's very different!
Keep up the good, global work,
Linda
Kris Childress (2012-12-03) #Hi Derek: As usual, your brief provocative posting elicits a torrent of responses. I think you hit a motherlode with this one!
I agree in the main but would add a few qualifiers:
1- Local/Global are a continuum and each of us gravitates to some point on the scale. That can and should change over time for most people. The better global perspective we have the better we can act locally.
2- To connect globally only online is not really being fully global. To really be global you need to travel to a host of places and immerse yourself in the local food, culture, discussions, art, geography, history, sights and sounds. Otherwise other places are too easily abstractions or &amp;quot;Disney-fied&amp;quot; concepts in your mind.  Keep in mind that - with modern transport and infrastructure - this is a possibility for many people today. For most of human history this has been the privilege of a tiny minority.
3- If you are privileged to live in a global metro area you can get a somewhat global experience regularly. In Chicago I would eat in immigrant restaurants with imported music (even television) blaring in the background and have conversations with the manager and staff. Some Saturday mornings I would drive around the city with a PRC-born friend delivering donated household goods to newly arrived PRC scholars living in the city. Last Saturday night here in Singapore I went to a dinner for about 60 global citizens from Singapore, US, Indonesia, Australia, Israel, etc. Had a long conversation with a Jewish fellow who has homes in Penang, Oakland CA and Singapore.
4 In addition to not being a slave to the &amp;quot;here&amp;quot; (local) I think that it is also important to not be a slave to the &amp;quot;now&amp;quot; (temporal) but to strive to understand some of history and WHY things are the way they are now. Just as global experience and perspective can help you to understand and act more effectively locally, historical perspective can help you be more effective in the &amp;quot;now&amp;quot;.
Finally, Derek, fellow USian living in Singapore, we are overdue for a coffee. Probably in the New Year!
Blessings,
Kris
Reema Sathe (2012-12-03) #Very Interesting! At times i face this dilemma and i feel guilty that why i am so much doing things online and not connecting to friends/family/community online. But as you rightly said we have make our choice. However i still feel that at times its good to keep in touch with the community around it just opens up some insights we might not have been thinking about
Michael Smith-Sardior (2012-12-03) #Thank you for the inside scoop of your mind. I appreciate your thoughts and have had the same kinds of things running around in my mind. You helped me solidify some previously nebulous thoughts about what I'm doing. Keep up your good work!
Hector Vas (Austin,tx) (2012-12-03) #Yes, we'll said.
 It's like playing a local  gig just to keep your chops up where the crowd is hmmmm or just staying home to record and create new music for the world.
Everyone is moving to Austin thinking its the greatest city to get started, but in reality it's somewhat over hyped
One idea I had was trying to create an iPhone app where a band could get booked localy or nation wide. With strict pay guidelines.
Playing in a city where there is a band around every corner is hard especially when bands will play on the cheap.
Why do bands need booking managers shouldn't there be an app for that.
I gotta get out of texas...
Spain here I come!!!!!
Cheers!!!!
Glad your back!!
Chantelle Baxter (2012-12-03) #Awesome post. Sometimes I think there is something wrong with me because my focus is so global and I always feel like I'm doing something wrong by neglecting the local. Sometimes I get asked why I focus on places that are so far from my home, and why don't I turn my attention to local issues instead.
I just don't get as passionate about local issues.
Glad to hear that you've tried both sides, and you've realised global is more your way. I might have to try that too ;)
Thanks Derek!
Heidi Anne Breyer (2012-12-03) #...and there-in lies the dichotomy many of us are in, including me.
I would love to do more local/regional recitals. I am selling records and getting a large amount of air play globally yet with zero local recitals lined up for the following reasons...
I'm a pianist and don't play bars. Only concert halls, churches and only pianos not keyboards. Original music not top 40 stuff.
I have to pay for the venues (and other musicians) it costs too much.
I remain introspective and from that mind-set I produce my best work.
I don't want to schmooze local people for the sake of getting known locally...and it's too hard to explain. They would just think I've gone nuts!
Few people know me as a recording artists, just Heidi, &amp;quot;the go-to piano teacher in the area that does a bit of composing, I think...&amp;quot;
Not an easy gap to bridge but it's happening one coffee at a time in the local cafe ;)
Good luck with your next chapter, Derek.
Artie Tobia (2012-12-03) #Derek,
 I have been waiting to hear what you would have to say upon your return. The balance between the two local and global is well stated. There are in my experience some people who have a talent perhaps even a gift to influence /share their perspectives. You are one of those people who is able to provoke people's thinking allowing or causing them to grow. The times I have spoken with you at a variety of events over the years only confirms that for me.
Yours is one of the few voice larger than the local community that serves well globally. At the same time you have no obligation to anyone but yourself to share and expand thinking. I have always admired that about you; to make decisions that keep you moving geographically or in business. This is not about friendships, I too keep in touch by phone and occasional visits with those I have developed friendships with, most of whom I have met in person over my years of performing. What you are talking about, I think, is making a difference. This is best served through creating.
I am grateful we can look forward to more from you in the future once again. Great to have you back you are needed. Have you decided what will be up for first for your return? Good Luck!

Mike Spinrad (2012-12-03) #Derek:
You have discovered a nice paradigm. I like a balance of playing music live (local) and writing for my blog (global). Since I will benefit from your new commitment to globalism, I am happy.
Eric Shenkman (2012-12-03) #We all need to unplug from babylon.   We all need to shape our position in it.  Some of those moves are dependent upon what is occurring outside of us.    Hence the need to mingle.
Danelle Harvey (2012-12-03) #I concur! Spot on. Good to hear from you again Derek.
Thank you.
Amandah Jantzen (2012-12-03) #Wow, I just woke up and we're already at the mid-400's? You have obviously been missed...
I appreciated this, (and will read  all of the comments when I have more time!)  I am a bit of a mix I guess.  I travel 95% of the time, but in each place I work, (anywhere from 3 to 12 months), I get more local while there.  I really tend to make myself at home, and I end up feeling that I'm leaving home from almost every place I depart.  And yet, I still consider Portland home, and every time I return, even if it's only for a week between gigs, I am SO happy to be there and so grateful to call that wonderful city my home.
I make friends and stay in touch with them all via email &amp;amp; SKYPE, and every once in awhile someone will pop into one of my gigs (in Asia) from another Asian country or even the US, and surprise me.  (That happened 3 times just last week!)
It's interesting that a lot of folks I meet out here assume I must be lonely because I don't (in their opinion) have any &amp;quot;roots&amp;quot; (or maybe that just means because I am single and without kids?)  They look at me disbelievingly when I say I am never bored or lonely.  Now I can send them this link!
Thanks, Derek--I hope you are still in Singapore by the time I get my next booking there!!
Mary Ann Farley (2012-12-03) #We move in and out of phases, none being more important than the other. That person you counseled individually? Perhaps she's the next Lady Gaga or next congresswoman. And this blog post that goes to so many? It's got a lot of people thinking out of the box, but I miss the personal connection with you. You're out of reach, as we're strangers to each other. I feel a small hole.
It's all good Derek. We all just have to do the work that we feel serves the greater good. Some are driven to serve many, while others (like psychotherapists) thrive on serving the one.
It's certainly great to read your blog again, so welcome back! Glad you found your footing.
Shang (2012-12-03) #Very insightful article!
Your article have hit a home run in the internal conflict in me and I can relate totally. I too, am living in Singapore now and feel that we are too locally-minded and many of us stick with a place (which includes the same job till the end of our lifes).  I intend to be go global and yet be present, enjoying the local pleasants where I am.
Thanks Derek for the eye opener!
Steven Moody (2012-12-03) #Derek,
Glad you're back to producing globally, though I wouldn't want to judge every local investment by the results in Singapore
For another take on this dichotomy see Venkatesh Rao's approach:

Gwen Adams (2012-12-03) #Ironically we are making what feels like a global move to do a local tour in hopes of reaching an international audience, with kids in tow.
We are at the cusp of packing our 3 kids in an RV and driving off the edge of normal so my husband can give his lifelong music dream one more chance. The Red Dirt music scene of TX/OK and beyond has adopted him, but TX radio is committed only to those local artists who tour there. He didn't want to leave us in Nashville, so I proposed going with him. We homeschool and I believe &amp;quot;home is where the heart is&amp;quot; so for the next year home will have wheels as he plays for our supper in Red Dirt country.  I'll share our adventure through RedDirtForDinner.com and www.facebook.com/RedDirtForDinner.
His very local family is acting as though we're throwing the kids on camels to take off across the Sahara. How in the world can we as parents do this to our children?!
&amp;quot;They need roots!&amp;quot;
But that statement made my toes wiggle - thank God for FEET! not roots
As a mom more than anything I want my children to have peace within and eyes that look without.  I want the world to be their backyard, and their friends to be those rare and precious people that they have a bond with that isn't effected by time or space.
I have a few like that - in different cities, states and continents. None are local, despite be involved in local churches, boys scouts, baseball leagues, co-ops, etc.  I too have poured myself out locally until I feel dry, but familiarity and friendship aren't the same.
Thanking God tonight literally that you are again sharing globally as I nervously wait for tomorrow's phone call to let us know if sponsorship has come through so we can start this unorthodox adventure.
So here's to the roots that matter, the ones that don't need dirt in a locality, but instead roots that wrap around hearts, pulling us together globally and making us stronger, steadier, and more balanced, so that our fruit falls where it is most needed.  Thankful tonight that I found a nugget, from Singapore, when I needed it most, in Nashville.
You my friend have a heart for humanity - who can touch more locally than that?
Bobby Jackson (2012-12-03) #Very thought provoking. Thanks for writing me.
陆晨 (2012-12-03) #Hi Derek,
Thanks for sharing your experience, and the most important, thank you to recommend the article to me.
From my point of view, as a young graduate candidate, or a rookie in my career, I should go to more places and learn more from the people I met everywhere. I think this is an effective way for me to make progress. Trying to get a job in Singapore is one of my actions to be &amp;quot;global&amp;quot;. I think I should focus on the technology, and keep being better and better, and finally do something big. Making a change to the word is difficult, but it is not so hard to satisfy myself.
There is only one single thing that I am uncertain about, the working area. You know, most of the working opportunities in Singapore is about Web of App, I am not sure that it will develop very well in many years. Compared with the algorithms, data structure, machine learning and math, maybe the application system is much easier to learn. People who works on it will be replaceable by anyone else.
That's my doubt above. I would like to practice my adaptation and english and also the ability to live by myself. Meanwhile, I am afraid of waste my time for a few years on the area I do not like.
Anyway, I am looking forward to hearing from you.
Jo Nelsen (2012-12-03) #Couldn't help thinking as I scrolled down the massive number of replies your posting prompted - how long would have these interchanges taken one on one?!
Hemingway said, &amp;quot;There are some things which cannot be learned quickly, and time, which is all we have, must be paid heavily for their acquiring. They are the very simplest things, and because it takes a man's life to know them the little new that each man gets from life is very costly and the only heritage he has to leave.

Pushkar Bajpai (2012-12-03) #Hi Derek, I attended a small meet by a local travelling group in Bangalore, India recently. One of the founders said an interesting thing that without a concept of home there won't be a foreign place to discover. So in a way home (local) is necessary but it doesn't imply that home (local) is static! Home (local) could be a place relative to the foreign (global). So wherever I'm right now is my local and I'm free to discover or be global.
I don't know how relevant it is to your article. But somehow I felt I should share it with you
Cheers
Pushkar

Deborah Magone (2012-12-03) #Perfectly timed post in regards to my own stage of development Derek. I too am recently going inward to reach more outward. Getting back to writing, &amp;amp; recording vs trying to beat down local venue doors for very unrewarding gigs.      I've been doing that for a long time because it was my local safety zone. No pressure or deadlines. I've  lived on both coasts but always did the same; tried to be a big fish in a small safe pond. That theory doesn't work when our purpose is global.
For some its perfect, but for others like ourselves its just not. Best Wishes for continued successful service to others on a global scale !

Sharon L. Peralta (2012-12-03) #Good hearing from you Derek...and reading all (well, true confession: skimming most of) the comments. So many of us facing the same dilemma and reaching similar conclusions of choosing where best to spend our resources. I love my local community and hope to be part of making it better, but also recognize the larger concentric circles need to be attended to as well to have impact on my small local circle. Trying to find balance in it all.
Derek, I discovered some great artists through CD Baby that I otherwise would not have. Thank you! I still seek out stations that avoid corporate control and play more than big labels and focus on local artists. Many of the DJs and artists they play obviously are committed to issues that I (and I think many here) consider important. They're doing what they can to make a positive impact and that is inspiring. We all can't do it all for sure, but we all can do some and together we CAN make a difference.  Thanks to everyone here for the parts you play that I cannot. I'll do my best to hold up my end and in the end, we all can take pride in work we have done. It ALL matters!
I look forward to more food for thought from you and those who comment on it. Only through such community will we realize any sense of peace and justice in this world.
Harsh (2012-12-03) #Love the perspective Derek! I am a big believer that &amp;quot;you don't need others to be happy, happiness comes from within; but if given the choice wouldnt you rather have friends and family around because happiness shared is happiness multiplied?&amp;quot; I have 2 questions I was tackling with after reading your post so I wondered what you'd say about it:
1) Dont you feel like having your parents around? As my parents are ageing into their 70s I feel like they need me so taking off to distant lands feels uncomfortable.
2) how important is an understanding partner when you have such a non-conformist  perspective? Does your wife share the same philosophies as you or do you sometimes struggle to convince her of your ways?
Bob Patterson (2012-12-03) #I believe that these are both valid phenomena that are each vitally important in their own way. The global business is absolutely not going to stop and yet, there is a need to connect with people that walk past us on the street. Smiles and handshakes are local while internet business is multicultural and international. Blending the mythologies from around the world into a common understanding will bring about unparalleled growth in technology once the &amp;quot;Us&amp;quot; vs. &amp;quot;Them&amp;quot; disappears. This will benefit the most people. I don't think that we have a choice in this, we will become more global as our differences disappear. We can't stop being human on the local scale however.
The final decision comes down to how much value we place on helping an individual. If I help a person find work that is raising children, how does that compare with people around the world going to bed at night listening to my songs? Both are valuable and both take our time. The local one is very gratifying, while the global reaches more people. The question is, which one does the most good for the most people?
Maybe we should focus on the global without turning a blind eye to our community. Otherwise, how are we sure that what we are doing globally will even have the right message? Both can coexist.
Thanks again Derek
Best Regards
Bob Patterson

Steve Mann (2012-12-03) #It's a frustrating thing, being pulled in two different directions......and I definitely see your point, Derek. You presented  your point of view in a very diplomatic way. I, personally, have come to the conclusion that I'm a &amp;quot;local&amp;quot; kind of person. With my kind of budget, I'd be spreading myself too thin going globally. I like getting to know people on a personal basis. I don't make near as much money, but It makes me happy. Thanks so much, Derek, for your insight. I always take it to heart.

David Hooper (2012-12-03) #Interesting thoughts!
I lived in Columbus, OH for almost three years without knowing anybody, except for my girlfriend, more than casually. I'm an introvert, so it was a fine experience, but one day, when she was out of town, I thought, &amp;quot;If I wanted to go see a movie (or do anything) right now, I'd have nobody to do it with.&amp;quot;
When I decided to move back to Nashville, I made the decision to develop a local community around me. Not always easy, since I'm still an introvert and prefer to be alone most of the time, but worthwhile, I think.
I love what you said about the &amp;quot;pick your brain&amp;quot; session with one person. Curious to know how you reply to people who request that.
Mohit Pawar (2012-12-03) #This is a win-win-win Derek.

Neil Bullow (2012-12-03) #I've been struggling with this for years.
Feel guilty for not socializing more, have very little local contacts. Others said you have to go out there and meet people. They're going to help my business more so I tried to balance time, but never could.
Thanks for the write up. Now I'm convinced I don't have to put a foot on each boat. I don't try to do things globally, but only a small virtual company would do.
Joey Spencer (2012-12-03) #Derek, I think this a fantastic topic to explore.  You did a phenomenal job explaining it's complex characteristics.  It was also nice that you compared each side to scenarios in your life.  Personally I think it would be possible to do both of course.  However I think to find even the balance lets say 50-50 you are using 100% of your effort producing 50% for each side.  That being said I think by focussing entirely on one, even if it may be in cycles (living local for a period, then living global for a period or vice versa) the production of being 'Locked-In; 100% effort, over the long run it will naturally compensate.  Just my opinion, as I love all the feedback everyone else is contributing to this great topic.  Well done!
Joey.
Joe Uveges (2012-12-03) #Derek,
      Unlike many of the posts (and in my insanity I ready almost 200) I am really well established locally and have all the benefits of this.  Friends, great community, cool family life, incredible local fan base, churches to play at, festivals offered, house concert opps.  Etc.
       I get my 140 shows a year easily with virtually not a phone call.  However,  I find the global connection to be the challenge and I feel a fair amount of frustration at being unable to make that connection.  The busy local schedule leaves scant room for all the on-line work that needs doing, so I often just don't do it , or, in the name of attempting &amp;quot;some one thing&amp;quot; I throw some publicity against the virtual &amp;quot;e board&amp;quot; and hope it stickes.  It satisfies for a minute, but in the long haul does not seem to pay.
       Reading the posts, however, makes me a bit more thankful for the life I've had as a performer and songwriter.  Maybe a vibrant local scene can sustain my ever unsatisfied ego.  It feel that way right now anyway.    Thanks to you and all the cool letters posted.   Blessings.  J
Iasos (2012-12-03) #POWER comes from &amp;quot;multiplying yourself&amp;quot;.
Performing for 50 people helps a LIMITED number of people only ONCE.    Getting a CD out there helps an UNLIMITED number of people an UNLIMITED number of times.
For me, ONLY real advantage of doing things LOCALLY, is that it stimulates GLOBAL downloads of my music.
So I choose 80% GLOBAL / 20% LOCAL.
Arndt (2012-12-03) #Hi Derek,
good thoughts in this post. I am wondering if the question of local or global is not simply answered from an economical point of view. For you as writer and musician the cost of distribution is quite low, through internet probably zero. Limiting yourself to the local market means losing customers. For a farmer, restaurant and car factory owner the cost or distribution can be very high, so the closer their clients are the cheaper their distribution cost. Happy to enjoy more of your future products. A happy customer of yours!
P.S. If you will read the 468 answer to your post?
Jeff Irick (2012-12-03) #Interesting obervations, Derek. I would have to say that I'm not all one or the other. I'm member of Bike clubs and entrepreneurial groups locally but I have for many years been an active member of global forums. I very much enjoy being active in both scopes. I think it's good to be balanced. If you focus only on the local you become insular and miss a lot of experiences and insights you can gain from the global stage. If you focus only on the global perspective you miss out on the richness inherent in the local scene. Anyway, great post as always, Bud.
Yoni Levitan (2012-12-03) #Hi Derek,
That is an interesting way of looking at things. Recently I have also tried making more of an effort to do &amp;quot;global&amp;quot; things instead of &amp;quot;local&amp;quot; as well. My one difference in outlook though is that I find most of the deepest insights I get come from face-to-face interactions with others.
Along with reading a good book, I find that is the best way to grow as a person, whereas spending your time writing, coding, and recording music is more of a solitary act that while enabling you to reach a global audience, it effectively eliminates meaningful face-to-face human contact with people you don't already know.
Knowing you this is not something you will do for time eternal, so I have no doubts if you start to feel things are out of balance you will go back the other way along the continuum.
Ingrid Stabb (2012-12-03) #Hi Derek (and community), I'd like to just be &amp;quot;global.&amp;quot; Although my business model to offer an online tools based on the Enneagram does not seem robust enough to be self-sustaining. It seems I have to add in-person business consulting to fill in revenue gaps. But I drag my feet on that. I just want to do the first part. If you or anyone reading this has advice or a comment, don't hesitate to email me at ingrid.stabb.som.99@aya.yale.edu. Regards, Ingrid
David Schwartz (2012-12-03) #Very insightful Derek. And it makes sense, since it takes focus to accomplish anything at a high level. Multiple points of focus decrease the energy at any individual point. Sometimes it's frustrating to want to accomplish goals that are competing for your attention, realizing that your time invested is the most powerful and rarest asset.
Thanks for promoting a good conversation!
