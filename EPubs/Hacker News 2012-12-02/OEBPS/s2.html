INTRODUCTION: A CALL TO CRYPTOGRAPHIC ARMS
	    This book is not a manifesto. There is not time for that. This book is a
	    warning.
	    The world is not sliding, but galloping into a new transnational dystopia.
	    This development has not been properly recognized outside of national security
	    circles. It has been hidden by secrecy, complexity and scale. The internet,
	    our greatest tool of emancipation, has been transformed into the most dangerous
	    facilitator of totalitarianism we have ever seen. The internet is a threat
	    to human civilization.
	    These transformations have come about silently, because those who know what
	    is going on work in the global surveillance industry and have no incentives
	    to speak out. Left to its own trajectory, within a few years, global civilization
	    will be a postmodern surveillance dystopia, from which escape for all but
	    the most skilled individuals will be impossible. In fact, we may already
	    be there.
	    While many writers have considered what the internet means for global
	    civilization, they are wrong. They are wrong because they do not have the
	    sense of perspective that direct experience brings. They are wrong because
	    they have never met the enemy.
	    No description of the world survives first contact with the enemy.
	    We have met the enemy.
	    Over the last six years WikiLeaks has had conflicts with nearly every powerful
	    state. We know the new surveillance state from an insider's perspective,
	    because we have plumbed its secrets. We know it from a combatant's perspective,
	    because we have had to protect our people, our finances and our sources from
	    it. We know it from a global perspective, because we have people, assets
	    and information in nearly every country. We know it from the perspective
	    of time, because we have been fighting this phenomenon for years and have
	    seen it double and spread, again and again. It is an invasive parasite, growing
	    fat off societies that merge with the internet. It is rolling over the planet,
	    infecting all states and peoples before it.
	    What is to be done?
	    Once upon a time in a place that was neither here nor there, we, the constructors
	    and citizens of the young internet discussed the future of our new world.
	    We saw that the relationships between all people would be mediated by our
	    new world, and that the nature of states, which are defined by how people
	    exchange information, economic value, and force, would also change.
	    We saw that the merger between existing state structures and the internet
	    created an opening to change the nature of states.
	    First, recall that states are systems through which coercive force flows.
	    Factions within a state may compete for support, leading to democratic surface
	    phenomena, but the underpinnings of states are the systematic application,
	    and avoidance, of violence. Land ownership, property, rents, dividends, taxation,
	    court fines, censorship, copyrights and trademarks are all enforced by the
	    threatened application of state violence.
	    Most of the time we are not even aware of how close to violence we are, because
	    we all grant concessions to avoid it. Like sailors smelling the breeze, we
	    rarely contemplate how our surface world is propped up from below by darkness.
	    In the new space of the internet what would be the mediator of coercive force?
	    Does it even make sense to ask this question? In this otherworldly space,
	    this seemingly platonic realm of ideas and information flow, could there
	    be a notion of coercive force? A force that could modify historical records,
	    tap phones, separate people, transform complexity into rubble, and erect
	    walls, like an occupying army?
	    The platonic nature of the internet, ideas and information flows, is debased
	    by its physical origins. Its foundations are fiber optic cable lines stretching
	    across the ocean floors, satellites spinning above our heads, computer servers
	    housed in buildings in cities from New York to Nairobi. Like the soldier
	    who slew Archimedes with a mere sword, so too could an armed militia take
	    control of the peak development of Western civilization, our platonic realm.
	    The new world of the internet, abstracted from the old world of brute atoms,
	    longed for independence. But states and their friends moved to control our
	    new world -- by controlling its physical underpinnings. The state, like an
	    army around an oil well, or a customs agent extracting bribes at the border,
	    would soon learn to leverage its control of physical space to gain control
	    over our platonic realm. It would prevent the independence we had dreamed
	    of, and then, squatting on fiber optic lines and around satellite ground
	    stations, it would go on to mass intercept the information flow of our new
	    world -- its very essence even as every human, economic, and political
	    relationship embraced it. The state would leech into the veins and arteries
	    of our new societies, gobbling up every relationship expressed or communicated,
	    every web page read, every message sent and every thought googled, and then
	    store this knowledge, billions of interceptions a day, undreamed of power,
	    in vast top secret warehouses, forever. It would go on to mine and mine again
	    this treasure, the collective private intellectual output of humanity, with
	    ever more sophisticated search and pattern finding algorithms, enriching
	    the treasure and maximizing the power imbalance between interceptors and
	    the world of interceptees. And then the state would reflect what it had learned
	    back into the physical world, to start wars, to target drones, to manipulate
	    UN committees and trade deals, and to do favors for its vast connected network
	    of industries, insiders and cronies.
	    But we discovered something. Our one hope against total domination. A hope
	    that with courage, insight and solidarity we could use to resist. A strange
	    property of the physical universe that we live in.
	    The universe believes in encryption.
	    It is easier to encrypt information than it is to decrypt it.
	    We saw we could use this strange property to create the laws of a new world.
	    To abstract away our new platonic realm from its base underpinnings of
	    satellites, undersea cables and their controllers. To fortify our space behind
	    a cryptographic veil. To create new lands barred to those who control physical
	    reality, because to follow us into them would require infinite resources.
	    And in this manner to declare independence.
	    Scientists in the Manhattan Project discovered that the universe permitted
	    the construction of a nuclear bomb. This was not an obvious conclusion. Perhaps
	    nuclear weapons were not within the laws of physics. However, the universe
	    believes in atomic bombs and nuclear reactors. They are a phenomenon the
	    universe blesses, like salt, sea or stars.
	    Similarly, the universe, our physical universe, has that property that makes
	    it possible for an individual or a group of individuals to reliably,
	    automatically, even without knowing, encipher something, so that all the
	    resources and all the political will of the strongest superpower on earth
	    may not decipher it. And the paths of encipherment between people can mesh
	    together to create regions free from the coercive force of the outer state.
	    Free from mass interception. Free from state control.
	    In this way, people can oppose their will to that of a fully mobilized superpower
	    and win. Encryption is an embodiment of the laws of physics, and it does
	    not listen to the bluster of states, even transnational surveillance dystopias.
	    It isn't obvious that the world had to work this way. But somehow the universe
	    smiles on encryption.
	    Cryptography is the ultimate form of non-violent direct action. While nuclear
	    weapons states can exert unlimited violence over even millions of individuals,
	    strong cryptography means that a state, even by exercising unlimited violence,
	    cannot violate the intent of individuals to keep secrets from them.
	    Strong cryptography can resist an unlimited application of violence. No amount
	    of coercive force will ever solve a math problem.
	    But could we take this strange fact about the world and build it up to be
	    a basic emancipatory building block for the independence of mankind in the
	    platonic realm of the internet? And as societies merged with the internet
	    could that liberty then be reflected back into physical reality to redefine
	    the state?
	    Recall that states are the systems which determine where and how coercive
	    force is consistently applied.
	    The question of how much coercive force can seep into the platonic realm
	    of the internet from the physical world is answered by cryptography and the
	    cypherpunks' ideals.
	    As states merge with the internet and the future of our civilization becomes
	    the future of the internet, we must redefine force relations.
	    If we do not, the universality of the internet will merge global humanity
	    into one giant grid of mass surveillance and mass control.
	    We must raise an alarm. This book is a watchman's shout in the night.
	    On March 20, 2012, while under house arrest in the United Kingdom awaiting
	    extradition, I met with three friends and fellow watchmen on the principle
	    that perhaps in unison our voices can wake up the town. We must communicate
	    what we have learned while there is still a chance for you, the reader, to
	    understand and act on what is happening.
	    It is time to take up the arms of our new world, to fight for ourselves and
	    for those we love.
	    Our task is to secure self-determination where we can, to hold back the coming
	    dystopia where we cannot, and if all else fails, to accelerate its
	    self-destruction.
