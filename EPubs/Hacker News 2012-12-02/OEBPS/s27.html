Here comes the first real alternative to iPhone and Android
							By Christopher Mims &amp;mdash; December 2, 2012
If you talk to enough people at the Finnish mobile startup Jolla, at some point it occurs to you that the company it most resembles is Apple. Not the Apple of today, which is basically a half-trillion-dollar supply chain with a design appendage, but Apple back when it was Steve Jobs obsessing over the creation of the Macintosh, which was radical in its focus on the user. In demos, at least, Jolla&amp;#8217;s decidedly different new mobile operating system (OS), called Sailfish, looks that good.
Sailfish, Jolla insists, will become a legitimate alternative to the Coke and Pepsi of smartphone platforms: Apple&amp;#8217;s iOS and Google&amp;#8217;s Android. Microsoft would like to accomplish the same thing, and has spent billions trying, with limited success; it has already cut back production for the new tablet running its latest OS, Windows 8. So what makes this group of fewer than 100-odd Finns, most of them refugees from the sinking ship that is Nokia, think they stand a chance?
&amp;#8220;China… is the most dynamic smartphone market—it&amp;#8217;s really booming,&amp;#8221; said Sami Pienimäki, who runs sales at Jolla, at the company&amp;#8217;s Nov. 21 unveiling of its new OS in Helsinki. &amp;#8220;There is 80%-100% year-on-year growth.&amp;#8221; (At least one projection suggests that the number of smartphones in China could grow by 150% in the next year alone, to 500 million devices.)
Jolla cannot possibly take on Google and Apple head-to-head, and it doesn&amp;#8217;t plan to. Rather, the company, which is rapidly becoming a Finnish-Chinese hybrid with headquarters in both Helsinki and Hong Kong, and an R&amp;amp;D operation in a yet-to-be-named location in mainland China, plans to nurture and grow an entirely new mobile &amp;#8220;ecosystem&amp;#8221;—meaning the phones, the operating system that runs on them, and the apps that run on that. And it plans to do it in China because that is the one market producing first-time buyers of smartphones fast enough to give such a scheme a chance.
In order to get its operating system and, eventually, Jolla-branded phones, in front of enough Chinese, the company has partnered with the largest mobile chain retailer in the country, D.Phone. Not only will D.Phone sell Sailfish-powered phones through its 2100 outlets; it is also part of the Sailfish Alliance, a group of software and hardware companies that will all be able to add standards and code to the open-source OS.
The deal with D.Phone isn&amp;#8217;t just a feather in Jolla&amp;#8217;s cap; in some respects, it&amp;#8217;s the reason it exists. It represents an early commitment from an established player with reach but no devices of its own, and a built-in market for what would otherwise be an even more hugely risky proposition.
A radical user interface
Sailfish&amp;#8217;s user interface
Jolla
Jolla CEO Marc Dillon believes that both iOS and Android are, essentially, boring technological dead-ends where innovation has gone to die. And if you cruise YouTube for the various hands-on videos demonstrating the Sailfish OS, you begin to get a sense of what he means. Visually, Sailfish doesn&amp;#8217;t seem very radical, but the mechanics of how people interact with it are.
Sailfish is designed to acknowledge that most people use their phones for several things at once these days. The phone&amp;#8217;s home screen can be filled with up to 9 concurrently running applications. (Contrast that with an iPhone, where, save for things like playing music, applications are paused when a user switches from one to another.) And they can all be controlled without even &amp;#8220;opening&amp;#8221; them. Rather, each &amp;#8220;application cover&amp;#8221;—which is a large rectangle on the phone&amp;#8217;s home screen—has its own interface.
The basis of this is &amp;#8220;swipe&amp;#8221; gestures, a convention borrowed from the Nokia N9, a one-of-a-kind phone that Nokia developed in alliance with Intel and released in 2011. It ran on a unique operating system called MeeGo, which is a direct ancestor of Sailfish. (Most of the Jolla team came from Nokia and previously worked on MeeGo, and while Jolla has no financial ties to the company, spiritually it&amp;#8217;s a spin-off.) Swiping from one side of a tile or the other will, for instance, skip tracks if it&amp;#8217;s a music player, or flip through contacts if it&amp;#8217;s the address book.
While in some ways Sailfish superficially resembles the Windows phone, which has a home screen full of &amp;#8220;live tiles&amp;#8221; displaying information from various apps, the tiles&amp;#8217; only other function in Windows is to open the app when you tap them. The Jolla team seems to have asked itself: What does the user want to accomplish, and what&amp;#8217;s the smallest number of taps required to accomplish it?
&amp;#8220;I believe that when people try [Sailfish] and use it for a few minutes, it&amp;#8217;s going to resonate with them,&amp;#8221; says Marc Dillon, CEO of Sailfish. &amp;#8220;It enables things that are much more different than on other devices. It makes them effortless.&amp;#8221;
A radical business model
China will have as many as 500 million smartphones by 2013

Ease of use is one part of Jolla&amp;#8217;s plan. Market reach is another.
In China, things work a little differently than they do in rich countries. Retailers like D.Phone, for example, wield outsize influence over the rest of the mobile device market. In the West, cell-phone carriers generally pay the handset-makers part of the cost of a phone in return for being the exclusive carrier for that particular device. In such a market, a new phone based on an OS that nobody has heard of doesn&amp;#8217;t stand a chance because the carriers won&amp;#8217;t take a gamble on it; they might not recoup their outlay. In China, however, the retailers buy handsets and charge customers full price for them. The way carriers compete for exclusivity is to offer retailers and their customers the biggest possible amount of free airtime.
That means that if D.Phone decides it wants to take a chance on a new device, carriers can&amp;#8217;t really veto its decision. And D.Phone, and presumably other retailers, has much more incentive than the carriers do to offer something truly different, because otherwise the only way it can compete with other retailers is on price.
&amp;#8220;In China, many families are coming to the point where they&amp;#8217;re either saving for their first real smartphone or they&amp;#8217;re ready for the next one,&amp;#8221; says Dillon. &amp;#8220;They really do want to stand out and have something a bit different.&amp;#8221; Android dominates in China, capturing nearly 80% of all Smartphone sales. Apple&amp;#8217;s iPhone stands out and is different, but it&amp;#8217;s also hugely expensive for a country in which the average yearly household income is still only about $9,000.
Coke, Pepsi&amp;#8230; and Red Bull?
Jolla has a lot to show off–just not yet a phone, said former Jolla CEO Jussi Hurmola at the Mindtrek digital media and business festival on Oct. 5 in Tampere, Finland
Ari Marjamäki
Andreas Constantinou, managing director of Mobile Vision, a telecoms consultancy, isn&amp;#8217;t buying the Jolla story.
&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s impossible for anyone to compete with the duopoly of Google and Apple,&amp;#8221; says Constantinou. The mobile market, at least in rich countries, is winner-take-all. Users don&amp;#8217;t care who makes their phone, he argues; they care whether or not it will run the apps they want. Developers, meanwhile, only want to create apps for the platforms with the most users. The result is that Apple and its fast follower Google, which pioneered the smartphone app store, have made it too hard for newcomers to enter the market. The mass of users who are already attached to their iPhones and Android devices because of their wide choice of apps are, in a way, the real value of those platforms.
&amp;#8220;Take the case of Jolla,&amp;#8221; says Constantinou. &amp;#8220;In order to start spinning its network effects, it needs to have a critical mass of either users or developers.&amp;#8221; He adds, &amp;#8220;Microsoft has spent five to ten billion dollars and still hasn&amp;#8217;t been able to compete. And that&amp;#8217;s two years after they&amp;#8217;ve introduced Windows phone. It&amp;#8217;s like there&amp;#8217;s Coke and Pepsi and everyone else—good luck.&amp;#8221;
The comparison of smartphones to soda is an idea invented by Peter Bryer, who spent 16 years in high-level management at Nokia. So what does he think of Jolla? On his blog, he says the company may be the &amp;#8220;Red Bull&amp;#8221; of this marketplace, a company that could &amp;#8220;hit an industry from the side with something different, something fresh, and something unexpected.&amp;#8221;
A team of rivals
Jolla&amp;#8217;s leadership is well aware of how hard it is to break into a field of entrenched behemoths. One of its solutions is an &amp;#8220;interpretation layer&amp;#8221; that allows Jolla phones to run most Android apps. But for a lot of people to start using Jolla phones, even in a country like China where many are not yet attached to a particular platform, Sailfish is going to need its own apps, and people to build them, as Constantinou points out.
The company has tried hard to create a culture that will attract such people. Because it&amp;#8217;s run by software developers, it espouses values—like sharing, collaboration and transparency—beloved by developers, who it hopes will contribute code for free in their spare time, as typically happens with open-source projects. Android, also open-source, has captured some of that goodwill, but the only company allowed to contribute code to Android is Google itself. Google has also been using heavy-handed tactics to keep Android handset manufacturers in line.
Jolla also comes from a country that is now legendary for its programming prowess. Home of Rovio, maker of Angry Birds, the most-downloaded paid game on iTunes ever, and Supercell, one of the fastest growing game studios ever, Finland is a good place to be popular with programmers. &amp;#8220;Finland is a country of five million people and it sure feels like we have five million supporters here,&amp;#8221; says Dillon.
Jolla itself has grown from a staff of around 50 in August, expecting to reach 100 by the end of 2012. Many of them will be located in Hong Kong, which will be the headquarters of the Sailfish Alliance.
Open to modification
The alliance symbolizes another key thing that Jolla says will make it different: the company aims to have less control over Sailfish than any other OS maker has over its OS. The purpose of the alliance—which includes Tencent, one of China&amp;#8217;s leading online companies, and ST-Ericsson, maker of the chips that already power at least a dozen different Android smartphones—is to make it possible for the various handset makers, software companies and mobile carriers who have a stake in the success of Sailfish to dig into the guts of the OS, make suggestions, tweak it for local markets, and put in new services that can help them generate revenue.
So, for example, if a company like Samsung offers an Android handset, it has to obey by rules laid down by Google so that it can include the Android app store, called Google Play, on its devices. It can&amp;#8217;t use another app store. Revenue from Google Play goes to Google, not Samsung. By contrast, if a carrier wants to include, for example, its own app store or music service in Sailfish, that&amp;#8217;s no problem.
Dillon says that even though Sailfish will always be open-source, Jolla will make money by licensing the patents the company has on its unusual user interface. He also hints at other, more radical business models that revolve around, for example, making it easier to match users with apps, but he says he can&amp;#8217;t yet discuss them. &amp;#8221;I don&amp;#8217;t want to go head-to-head with the two big app stores,&amp;#8221; says Dillon. &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;d like to do something a bit different.&amp;#8221;
Freedom from the patent wars
Jolla&amp;#8217;s final advantage is that it believes it can stay out of what has become a massively expensive conflict between phone-makers over intellectual property. Hardly a day goes by that some holder of mobile patents doesn&amp;#8217;t initiate a lawsuit against another—the latest is Nokia versus RIM, maker of the Blackberry, and in August a US court awarded Apple $1 billion in damages in its patent infringement suit against Samsung. &amp;#8220;There were massive investments from previous customers [Intel and Nokia] to clear MeeGo [now Sailfish] from intellectual property issues,&amp;#8221; says Jussi Hurmola, former CEO of Jolla and now a consultant to the company.
This also means that Jolla offers a sweetener to carriers. Because its interface is so different and the OS was written specifically to avoid infringing existing patents, it could be free of the de-facto licensing fees that usually come with using Android on a phone. (As a result, while Google charges nothing for Android, Microsoft is the one that makes money every time an Android-powered handset is sold.)
The Steve moment
&amp;#8220;Many people have told us that this is not possible… that the market is flooded,&amp;#8221; Jolla VP Pienimäki said at the Sailfish launch. To argue for why the company should succeed he pointed to Jolla&amp;#8217;s deal with D.Phone, but also to the research the company has done on Chinese consumers. &amp;#8220;We spent hundreds of hours studying the marketplace and consumer behavior in the field, in shops, malls, streets; seeing consumer behavior in the metro, subways, bars. […] That&amp;#8217;s the key power of this company—the management is in the field all the time. You can&amp;#8217;t outsource this kind of market insight.&amp;#8221;
There is a Steve-Jobs-like quality to the pride Dillon and Hurmolla take in their creation and their exacting standards for ease of use. I ask Dillon if he would compare his company to Apple.
&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s fair enough,&amp;#8221; says Dillon. &amp;#8220;We inherited some things from MeeGo, and  and some of this has evolved into things have become a bit more revolutionary. We&amp;#8217;ve really simplified the interaction, and made a lot of things easier to use so they require far less interaction. […] I would like for this to be a major disruption.&amp;#8221;
But acting like Steve Jobs and succeeding like Steve Jobs are two very different things. Jolla will unveil its first handsets, and its super-secret alternative business models, around the beginning of 2013, says Dillon, and phones running Jolla should be available by the spring. Even if Jolla ultimately succeeds in China or manages to become the &amp;#8220;Red Bull&amp;#8221; of the smartphone world, that will be just the beginning of a very long battle.

Not the Apple of today, which is basically a half-trillion-dollar supply chain with a design appendage, but Apple back when it was Steve Jobs obsessing over the creation of the Macintosh, which was radical in its focus on the user. In demos, at least, Jolla&amp;#8217;s decidedly different new mobile operating system (OS), called Sailfish, looks that good.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESailfish, Jolla insists, will become a legitimate alternative to the Coke and Pepsi of smartphone platforms: Apple&amp;#8217;s iOS and Google&amp;#8217;s Android. Microsoft would like to accomplish the same thing, and has spent billions trying, with limited success; it has already \u003Ca title=\"Microsoft just cut in half its orders to suppliers for the Surface RT tablet\" href=\"http:\/\/qz.com\/32265\/microsoft-just-cut-in-half-its-orders-to-suppliers-for-the-surface-rt-tablet\/\"\u003Ecut back production\u003C\/a\u003E\u00a0for the new tablet running its latest OS, Windows 8.

Rather, the company, which is rapidly becoming a Finnish-Chinese hybrid with headquarters in both Helsinki and Hong Kong, and an R&amp;amp;D operation in a yet-to-be-named location in mainland China, plans to nurture and grow an entirely new mobile &amp;#8220;ecosystem&amp;#8221;\u2014meaning the phones, the operating system that runs on them, and the apps that run on that. And it plans to do it in China because that is the one market producing first-time buyers of smartphones fast enough to give such a scheme a chance.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to get its operating system and, eventually, Jolla-branded phones, in front of enough Chinese, the company has \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.pcmag.com\/article2\/0,2817,2407191,00.asp\"\u003Epartnered with the largest mobile chain retailer in the country\u003C\/a\u003E, D.Phone. Not only will D.Phone sell Sailfish-powered phones through its 2100 outlets; it is also part of the Sailfish Alliance, a group of software and hardware companies that will all be able to add standards and code to the open-source OS.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe deal with D.Phone isn&amp;#8217;t just a feather in Jolla&amp;#8217;s cap; in some respects, it&amp;#8217;s the reason it exists. It represents an early commitment from an established player with reach but no devices of its own, and a built-in market for what would otherwise be an even more hugely risky proposition.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cb\u003EA radical user interface\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/h2\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"qz-inline-image alignnone\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"http:\/\/qzprod.files.wordpress.com\/2012\/11\/jolla_ui_image.jpg?w=766&amp;#038;h=575\" width=\"766\" height=\"575\" class=\"size-full\" data-retina=\"http:\/\/qzprod.files.wordpress.com\/2012\/11\/jolla_ui_image.jpg?w=766&amp;#038;h=575\" alt=\"\" title=\"Sailfish&amp;#8217;s user interface\"\/\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"caption\"\u003ESailfish&amp;#8217;s user interface\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"credit\"\u003EJolla\u003C\/span\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJolla CEO Marc Dillon believes that both iOS and Android are, essentially, boring technological dead-ends where innovation has gone to die. And if you cruise YouTube for the various hands-on videos demonstrating the Sailfish OS, you begin to get a sense of what he means. Visually, Sailfish doesn&amp;#8217;t seem very radical, but the mechanics of how people interact with it are.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESailfish is designed to acknowledge that most people use their phones for several things at once these days. The phone&amp;#8217;s home screen can be filled with up to 9 concurrently running applications. (Contrast that with an iPhone, where, save for things like playing music, applications are paused when a user switches from one to another.) And they can all be controlled without even &amp;#8220;opening&amp;#8221; them. Rather, each &amp;#8220;application cover&amp;#8221;\u2014which is a large rectangle on the phone&amp;#8217;s home screen\u2014has its own interface.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cspan class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'\u003E\u003Ciframe class='youtube-player' type='text\/html' width='640' height='390' src='http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/_c_BqnR_vAM?version=3&amp;#038;rel=1&amp;#038;fs=1&amp;#038;showsearch=0&amp;#038;showinfo=1&amp;#038;iv_load_policy=1&amp;#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'\u003E\u003C\/iframe\u003E\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe basis of this is &amp;#8220;swipe&amp;#8221; gestures, a convention borrowed from the Nokia N9, a one-of-a-kind phone that Nokia developed in alliance with Intel and released in 2011. It ran on a unique operating system called MeeGo, which is a direct ancestor of Sailfish. (Most of the Jolla team came from Nokia and previously worked on MeeGo, and while Jolla has no financial ties to the company, spiritually it&amp;#8217;s a spin-off.) Swiping from one side of a tile or the other will, for instance, skip tracks if it&amp;#8217;s a music player, or flip through contacts if it&amp;#8217;s the address book.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile in some ways Sailfish superficially resembles the Windows phone, which has a home screen full of &amp;#8220;live tiles&amp;#8221; displaying information from various apps, the tiles&amp;#8217; only other function in Windows is to open the app when you tap them. The Jolla team seems to have asked itself: What does the user want to accomplish, and what&amp;#8217;s the smallest number of taps required to accomplish it?\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&amp;#8220;I believe that when people try [Sailfish] and use it for a few minutes, it&amp;#8217;s going to resonate with them,&amp;#8221; says Marc Dillon, CEO of Sailfish. &amp;#8220;It enables things that are much more different than on other devices.

Market reach is another.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn China, things work a little differently than they do in rich countries. Retailers like D.Phone, for example, wield outsize influence over the rest of the mobile device market. In the West, cell-phone carriers generally pay the handset-makers part of the cost of a phone in return for being the exclusive carrier for that particular device. In such a market, a new phone based on an OS that nobody has heard of doesn&amp;#8217;t stand a chance because the carriers won&amp;#8217;t take a gamble on it; they might not recoup their outlay. In China, however, the retailers buy handsets and charge customers full price for them. The way carriers compete for exclusivity is to offer retailers and their customers the biggest possible amount of free airtime.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat means that if D.Phone decides it wants to take a chance on a new device, carriers can&amp;#8217;t really veto its decision. And D.Phone, and presumably other retailers, has much more incentive than the carriers do to offer something truly different, because otherwise the only way it can compete with other retailers is on price.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&amp;#8220;In China, many families are coming to the point where they&amp;#8217;re either saving for their first real smartphone or they&amp;#8217;re ready for the next one,&amp;#8221; says Dillon. &amp;#8220;They really do want to stand out and have something a bit different.&amp;#8221; Android dominates in China, capturing \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/english.analysys.com.cn\/article.php?aid=135148\"\u003Enearly 80%\u003C\/a\u003E of all Smartphone sales.

The mobile market, at least in rich countries, is winner-take-all. Users don&amp;#8217;t care who makes their phone, he argues; they care whether or not it will run the apps they want. Developers, meanwhile, only want to create apps for the platforms with the most users. The result is that Apple and its fast follower Google, which pioneered the smartphone app store, have made it too hard for newcomers to enter the market.\u00a0The mass of users who are already attached to their iPhones and Android devices because of their wide choice of apps are, in a way, the real value of those platforms.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&amp;#8220;Take the case of Jolla,&amp;#8221; says Constantinou. &amp;#8220;In order to start spinning its network effects, it needs to have a critical mass of either users or developers.&amp;#8221; He adds, &amp;#8220;Microsoft has spent five to ten billion dollars and still hasn&amp;#8217;t been able to compete. And that&amp;#8217;s two years after they&amp;#8217;ve introduced Windows phone. It&amp;#8217;s like there&amp;#8217;s Coke and Pepsi and everyone else\u2014good luck.&amp;#8221;\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe comparison of smartphones to soda is an idea invented by Peter Bryer, who spent 16 years in high-level management at Nokia. So what does he think of Jolla? On his blog, \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.peterbryer.com\/2012\/11\/jolla-unveiled.html\"\u003Ehe says\u003C\/a\u003E the company may be the &amp;#8220;Red Bull&amp;#8221; of this marketplace, a company that could &amp;#8220;hit an industry from the side with something different, something fresh, and something unexpected.&amp;#8221;\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cb\u003EA team of rivals\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/h2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJolla&amp;#8217;s leadership is well aware of how hard it is to break into a field of entrenched behemoths. One of its solutions is an &amp;#8220;interpretation layer&amp;#8221; that allows Jolla phones to run most Android apps. But for a lot of people to start using Jolla phones, even in a country like China where many are not yet attached to a particular platform, Sailfish is going to need its own apps, and people to build them, as Constantinou points out.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe company has tried hard to create a culture that will attract such people. Because it&amp;#8217;s run by software developers, it\u00a0espouses values\u2014like sharing, collaboration and transparency\u2014beloved by developers, who it hopes will contribute code for free in their spare time, as typically happens with open-source projects. Android, also open-source, has captured some of that goodwill, but the only company allowed to contribute code to Android is Google itself. Google has also been using \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.digitaltrends.com\/mobile\/google-and-alibaba-spar-over-acers-aliyun-phone\/\"\u003Eheavy-handed tactics\u003C\/a\u003E to keep Android handset manufacturers in line.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJolla also comes from a country that is now legendary for its programming prowess. Home of Rovio, maker of Angry Birds, the\u00a0\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/2012-11-22\/-angry-birds-fuels-finland-game-boom-as-investors-seek-next-hit.html\"\u003Emost-downloaded paid game on iTunes ever\u003C\/a\u003E, and Supercell, one of the\u00a0\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/pandodaily.com\/2012\/11\/27\/supercell-is-accels-fastest-growing-company-ever-and-it-has-a-ball-pit\/\"\u003Efastest growing game studios ever\u003C\/a\u003E, Finland is a good place to be popular with programmers. &amp;#8220;Finland is a country of five million people and it sure feels like we have five million supporters here,&amp;#8221; says Dillon.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJolla itself has grown from a staff of \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.zdnet.com\/jollas-meego-ui-is-ready-to-go-and-its-on-the-hunt-for-mobile-talent-7000002728\/\"\u003Earound 50\u003C\/a\u003E in August, expecting to reach 100 by the end of 2012. Many of them will be located in Hong Kong, which will be the headquarters of the Sailfish Alliance.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EOpen to modification\u003C\/h2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe alliance symbolizes another key thing that Jolla says will make it different: the company aims to have less control over Sailfish than any other OS maker has over its OS.\u00a0The purpose of the alliance\u2014which\u00a0includes Tencent, one of China&amp;#8217;s leading online companies, and ST-Ericsson, maker of the chips that already power at least a dozen different Android smartphones\u2014is to make it possible for the various handset makers, software companies and mobile carriers who have a stake in the success of Sailfish to\u00a0dig into the guts of the OS, make suggestions, tweak it for local markets, and put in new services that can help them generate revenue.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, for example, if a company like Samsung offers an Android handset, it has to obey by rules laid down by Google so that it can include the Android app store, called Google Play, on its devices. It can&amp;#8217;t use another app store. Revenue from Google Play goes to Google, not Samsung. By contrast, if a carrier wants to include, for example, its own app store or music service in Sailfish, that&amp;#8217;s no problem.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDillon says that even though Sailfish will always be open-source, Jolla will make money by licensing the patents the company has on its unusual user interface. He also hints at other, more radical business models that revolve around, for example, making it easier to match users with apps, but he says he can&amp;#8217;t yet discuss them.\u00a0&amp;#8221;I don&amp;#8217;t want to go head-to-head with the two big app stores,&amp;#8221; says Dillon. &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;d like to do something a bit different.&amp;#8221;\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EFreedom from the patent wars\u003C\/h2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJolla&amp;#8217;s final advantage is that it believes it can stay out of what has become a massively expensive conflict between phone-makers over intellectual property. Hardly a day goes by that some holder of mobile patents doesn&amp;#8217;t initiate a lawsuit against another\u2014the latest is Nokia versus RIM, maker of the Blackberry, and in August a US court awarded Apple $1 billion in damages in its patent infringement suit against Samsung. &amp;#8220;There were massive investments from previous customers [Intel and Nokia] to clear MeeGo [now Sailfish] from intellectual property issues,&amp;#8221; says Jussi Hurmola, former CEO of Jolla and now a consultant to the company.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis also means that Jolla offers a sweetener to carriers. Because its interface is so different and the OS was written specifically to avoid infringing existing patents, it could be free of the de-facto licensing fees that usually come with using Android on a phone. (As a result, while Google charges nothing for Android, \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/arstechnica.com\/information-technology\/2011\/10\/microsoft-collects-license-fees-on-50-of-android-devices-tells-google-to-wake-up\/\"\u003EMicrosoft is the one that makes money\u003C\/a\u003E every time an Android-powered handset is sold.)\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cb\u003EThe Steve moment\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/h2\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&amp;#8220;Many people have told us that this is not possible\u2026 that the market is flooded,&amp;#8221; Jolla VP Pienim\u00e4ki said at the Sailfish launch. To argue for why the company should succeed he pointed to Jolla&amp;#8217;s deal with D.Phone, but also to the research the company has done on Chinese consumers. &amp;#8220;We spent hundreds of hours studying the marketplace and consumer behavior in the field, in shops, malls, streets; seeing consumer behavior in the metro, subways, bars. [\u2026] That&amp;#8217;s the key power of this company\u2014the management is in the field all the time. You can&amp;#8217;t outsource this kind of market insight.&amp;#8221;\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a Steve-Jobs-like quality to the pride Dillon and Hurmolla take in their creation and their exacting standards for ease of use. I ask Dillon if he would compare his company to Apple.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s fair enough,&amp;#8221; says Dillon. &amp;#8220;We inherited some things from MeeGo, and\u00a0 and some of this has evolved into things have become a bit more revolutionary. We&amp;#8217;ve really simplified the interaction, and made a lot of things easier to use so they require far less interaction. [\u2026] I would like for this to be a major disruption.&amp;#8221;\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut acting like Steve Jobs and succeeding like Steve Jobs are two very different things. Jolla will unveil its first handsets, and its super-secret alternative business models, around the beginning of 2013, says Dillon, and phones running Jolla should be available by the spring. Even if Jolla ultimately succeeds in China or manages to become the &amp;#8220;Red Bull&amp;#8221; of the smartphone world, that will be just the beginning of a very long battle.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cdiv id=\"jp-post-flair\" class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E","featuredImage":{"id":32968,"alt":"","caption":"His team is building &amp;quot;a movement,&amp;quot; and not just a mobile OS, says Mark Dillon, CEO and co-founder of Jolla","credit":"Aaltoes \/ Peter Forsgard","sizes":{"small_30":{"url":"http:\/\/qzprod.files.wordpress.com\/2012\/11\/jolla.jpg?w=320","width":320,"height":180},"medium_20":{"url":"http:\/\/qzprod.files.wordpress.com\/2012\/11\/jolla.jpg?w=700","width":700,"height":393},"medium_40":{"url":"http:\/\/qzprod.files.wordpress.com\/2012\/11\/jolla.jpg?w=880","width":880,"height":495}}},"topPostsRank":1,"taxonomies":{"kicker":[{"name":"Sailfish","slug":"sailfish"}],"obsession":[{"name":"Mobile Web","slug":"mobile-web"}],"tags":[{"name":"Android","slug":"android"},{"name":"Apple","slug":"apple"},{"name":"Google","slug":"google"},{"name":"iOS","slug":"ios"},{"name":"iPhone","slug":"iphone"},{"name":"Jolla","slug":"jolla"},{"name":"mobile","slug":"mobile"},{"name":"Sailfish","slug":"sailfish"},{"name":"Samsung","slug":"samsung"},{"name":"smartphones","slug":"smartphones"},{"name":"Technology","slug":"technology"}]},"byline":{"authors":[{"name":"Christopher Mims","username":"mimsquartz","url":"http:\/\/qz.com\/author\/mimsquartz\/"}]}},{"id":33151,"title":"The first text message was sent 20 years ago","permalink":"http:\/\/qz.com\/33151\/the-first-text-message-was-sent-20-years-ago\/","date":{"published":"2012-12-02 17:46:08","updated":"2012-12-02 17:50:06"},"postType":"article","summary":"The very first text message was sent 20 years ago, on Dec. 3, 1992.

In most cases, an SMS is sent from one phone to another on a narrow slice of cellular bandwidth called the \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Control_channel\"\u003Econtrol channel\u003C\/a\u003E, an ever-present connection that&amp;#8217;s also used to notify phones of incoming calls and signal strength.

(In turn, that&amp;#8217;s why Twitter, which was originally based on SMS, limits tweets to 140 characters, in order to fit the message plus the sender in a single text message.) It&amp;#8217;s also why some people argue that wireless carriers gouge their customers by charging several cents per text when the marginal cost to the company is zero: the control channel is used whether or not it&amp;#8217;s transmitting an SMS.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, on its 20th birthday, the text message finds itself threatened by a host of free alternatives, from \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/bits.blogs.nytimes.com\/2012\/05\/11\/facebook-killing-sms\/\"\u003EFacebook messaging\u003C\/a\u003E to\u00a0\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/blogs.forrester.com\/ted_schadler\/11-12-21-imessage_killed_the_sms_star\"\u003EApple&amp;#8217;s iMessage\u003C\/a\u003E.

And he hardly fits the mold of the kind of wealthy man the French ruling class likes. Indeed, in 2006, Mittal was lectured by then-finance minister Thierry Breton when he wanted to merge Mittal with Arcelor for not understanding the &amp;#8220;etiquette\u201d of French business. And Montebourg and French politicians were far more lenient on French-owned multinationals like Peugeout and Sanofi-Aventis when they recently announced massive job losses in their thousands.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe French political establishment across the parties is too cynical. It is profiting from rising populism and desperately trying to shift blame for soaring unemployment\u2014it has risen for the 18th consecutive month to the highest level in 14 1\/2 years, with more than 3 million jobless\u2014and sinking competitiveness on to the foreign bogey.

Mittal\u2019s crime is to be a foreigner, and especially an Asian, who made his own fortune and billions. Even worse he has a vulgar propensity to display his wealth in an ostentatious fashion.

And, in light of the Syria situation, it has conducted &amp;#8220;a census, from our own view of the global Internet routing table, of all the domestic providers in each country who have direct connections (visible in routing) to foreign providers.&amp;#8221; Using that information, the firm created the chart above.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe illustration here is mostly unsurprising: Syria, Libya, Tunisia, Myanmar &amp;#8212; countries led by volatile and\/or autocratic regimes &amp;#8212; are the most at-risk, while (relatively) stable democracies and commonwealths like the U.S., Canada, and European nations are relatively resistant to blackout.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most common risk factor, unsurprisingly, is centralization. A robust Internet architecture is a distributed Internet architecture &amp;#8212; one with built-in redundancies and, crucially, one that is modular enough to prevent the kill switch capabilities that can empower bad actors to act badly. &amp;#8220;The key to the Internet&amp;#8217;s survival is the Internet&amp;#8217;s decentralization,&amp;#8221; the Renesys report notes, &amp;#8220;and it&amp;#8217;s not uniform across the world.&amp;#8221;\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegulation is another risk factor. Per Renesys:\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn some countries, international access to data and telecommunications services is heavily regulated. There may be only one or two companies who hold official licenses to carry voice and Internet traffic to and from the outside world, and they are required by law to mediate access for everyone else.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnder those circumstances, it&amp;#8217;s almost trivial for a government to issue an order that would take down the Internet. Make a few phone calls, or turn off power in a couple of central facilities, and you&amp;#8217;ve (legally) disconnected the domestic Internet from the global Internet. Of course, this level of centralization also makes it much harder for the government to defend the nation&amp;#8217;s Internet infrastructure against a determined opponent, who knows they can do a lot of damage by hitting just a few targets.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003C\/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the chart is based on diversity. And based on criteria and observations like these:\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIf you have only 1 or 2 companies at your international frontier, we classify your country as being at severe risk of Internet disconnection.\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIf you have fewer than 10 service providers at your international frontier, your country is probably exposed to some significant risk of Internet disconnection.\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIf you have more than 10 internationally-connected service providers, but fewer than about 40, your risk of disconnection is fairly low.\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFinally, if you have more than 40 providers at your frontier, your country is likely to be extremely resistant to Internet disconnection.\u003C\/li\u003E\u003C\/ul\u003E\u003C\/ul\u003E\u003C\/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are fairly common-sense. But it&amp;#8217;s good to put numbers behind risk, and nice to be reminded of how varied the world&amp;#8217;s Internet infrastructure is. And, specifically, how fragile connection is for so many countries. This is something, Renesys points out, that will likely be a subject of discussion at next week&amp;#8217;s\u00a0\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.itu.int\/en\/wcit-12\/Pages\/default.aspx\"\u003EWorld Conference on International Telecommunications\u003C\/a\u003E.

The only way to keep it up is to express milk at the same times that the baby would normally feed, generally every three to four hours. \u00a0This can be done manually but is most efficient with an electric pump that relies on horn-like devices cupped over the breasts to suction the milk.

Try asking a hospital if it has a place to pump, as I did this past spring when my mother had heart surgery and lots of complications. In between tending to her and dealing with doctors and nurses, I pumped in waiting rooms, intensive care units, public bathrooms, patient bathrooms, parking garages, and most often, by her bedside. At times, doctors mistook the suctioning sound of my pump for one of her machines. It was comical and I am hardly easily embarrassed (most of us who make it this far can\u2019t be), but there must be a better way.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome countries have especially strong track records on supporting working women\u2019s desire to breastfeed. \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2003\/10\/21\/world\/norway-leads-industrial-nations-back-to-breast-feeding.html\"\u003ENorway offers working mothers two hours off per day\u003C\/a\u003E to nurse, either at the office or at home.

Cynthia Nowak, a mother of two who lives in Seattle, recently traveled there and was impressed with its breastfeeding culture. Granted, few women do it in public but the result is that all the \u201cnurseries,\u201d as they\u2019re known, double as a place to actually feed a child or express milk for him. Among her most memorable mother-friendly places: the \u201ctourist center in Asakusa. I was shocked as it&amp;#8217;s not a big city, but a big tourist draw. They had two private rooms with comfy chairs, tables and outlets. In the larger room there was a changing table and sink.\u201d And, she adds, the \u201cNarita airport has a huge room with comfy chairs and a long metal sink. &amp;#8230;.

Minecraft got its full release on major gaming platforms this time last year. As of mid-November, \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.mojang.com\/\"\u003EMojang\u003C\/a\u003E, Persson\u2019s game studio, \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.pcgamer.com\/2012\/11\/12\/minecraft-reaches-8-million-pc-copies-sold-notch-celebrates-with-cryptic-number\/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Ereported it had sold over 8 million copies of the game for the PC alone\u003C\/a\u003E, with another three million downloads on iOS, Android, and purchases for XBox 360.

The game\u2019s open, often cooperative play, peer-built environments and simplicity has drawn an army of dedicated players who often spend days tunneling, hammering and building, just for the pleasure of making.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cb\u003EMove over, Dubai and Shanghai\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/h2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, the game is a simple \u201csandbox,\u201d or open world, designed to allow layers to spawn and move about in its 3D, isometric environment. Players dig and build carefully sculpted structures and spaces and gather \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.minecraftwiki.net\/wiki\/Items\"\u003Eitems\u003C\/a\u003E like food or tools, interacting or avoiding \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.minecraftwiki.net\/wiki\/Mobs\"\u003Emobs\u003C\/a\u003E, or characters, along the way. While Minecraft can be played in traditional survival (gather, create, stay alive), adventure (wander and interact) and hardcore (stay alive or lose everything) modes, the fourth mode, known as the creative mode of Minecraft, where multiple players build together freely, can be the most intriguing. Creative mode is where the interesting, complex and increasingly grandiose creations get built or \u201ccrafted\u201d using available resources and tools like the aforementioned pickaxe. Players can build houses, castles and caverns, but also edifices of Pyonyang-scale immensity and absurdity, like \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/boingboing.net\/2011\/05\/20\/mundaneminecraft.html\"\u003Esky-high apartment towers\u003C\/a\u003E, huge working \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.minecraftforum.net\/topic\/385231-my-giant-beatbox\/\"\u003Ebeatboxes\u003C\/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/planetivy.com\/gaming\/1781\/the-ten-most-mind-blowing-minecraft-creations\/\"\u003Erecreations of favorite buildings in painful detail\u003C\/a\u003E or \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/boingboing.net\/2011\/05\/20\/mundaneminecraft.html\"\u003Egiant abandoned strip malls\u003C\/a\u003E.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cspan class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'\u003E\u003Ciframe class='youtube-player' type='text\/html' width='640' height='390' src='http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/kRv2shv-yq4?version=3&amp;#038;rel=1&amp;#038;fs=1&amp;#038;showsearch=0&amp;#038;showinfo=1&amp;#038;iv_load_policy=1&amp;#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'\u003E\u003C\/iframe\u003E\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut clever Minecrafters haven\u2019t stopped with oddball buildings.

Early introduction of mechanical levers, circuits, and more recently a modification to add pistons to the game have encouraged players to build increasingly byzantine machines using the most basic of materials. Recent modifications and updates to the game, and unofficial variations created by expert players, such as \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.computercraft.info\/\"\u003ETekkit\u003C\/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.computercraft.info\/\"\u003EComputerCraft\u003C\/a\u003E, take game functionality to a new level with industrial machines and programmable in-game computers that aren\u2019t for entertainment as much as necessary elements to feed Minecrafters\u2019 growing appetite for engineering. Where a weekend electronics enthusiasts or desktop manufacturing fan might run down to a Radio Shack to grab some extra circuitry for an electronics project, Minecrafters are working in cross-country or sometimes multi-country teams to build energy production systems, massive water projects or underground house-making factories in the game\u2014partly as status symbols among other Minecrafters, and partly to push the boundaries of their own skill and the game\u2019s capabilities.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cb\u003EAn 8-bit tool for humanity\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/h2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis phenomenon of bright young minds exploring engineering through games hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed by experts in two important fields: international development and education.

Driven by teachers in the US and Finland, MinecraftEdu is taking a page from expert players and developing its own educational program to work with the game. The adapted game runs on a local server controlled by a teacher, the classroom setup allows a teacher to direct play more than occurs in a standard game while still leaving open play space for students to explore. One charter school group in Los Angeles, Da Vinci Schools, working in conjunction with MinecraftEDU and graduate students from Pepperdine University, has developed a specialized course called \u201c\u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/sites.google.com\/site\/mikosdavinciportal\/home\/electrical-engineering--minecraft\"\u003EElectrical Engineering &amp;amp; Minecraft\u003C\/a\u003E\u201d to teach about circuits and computing.

In a world where modifications, and peer-generated maps and tools circulate quickly, this use of other players\u2019 knowledge and creativity is both an adaptive survival tool and a form of social currency that keeps Minecraft and similar games ticking over with satisfied miners.

Many Saturday afternoons spent listening to a group of teens on Minecraft conceive, plan and build a massive energy transmission system makes me wonder whether, come the next Sandy or other storm of the century, these aren\u2019t the kids who will have perhaps already restructured a major metropolitan sea front, remapped the bridges and tunnels, rerouted storm drainage and, who might not be standing by to offer a plan to rebuild for the next time. Minecraft, or its unforeseen offspring, might not be just a new on-ramp to a technical education, it may be the platform itself.

(Most of the Jolla team came from Nokia and previously worked on MeeGo, and while Jolla has no financial ties to the company, spiritually it&amp;#8217;s a spin-off.)

In the West, cell-phone carriers generally pay the handset-makers part of the cost of a phone in return for being the exclusive carrier for that particular device. In such a market, a new phone based on an OS that nobody has heard of doesn&amp;#8217;t stand a chance because the carriers won&amp;#8217;t take a gamble on it; they might not recoup their outlay. In China, however, the retailers buy handsets and charge customers full price for them. The way carriers compete for exclusivity is to offer retailers and their customers the biggest possible amount of free airtime.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat means that if D.Phone decides it wants to take a chance on a new device, carriers can&amp;#8217;t really veto its decision.

On his blog, \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.peterbryer.com\/2012\/11\/jolla-unveiled.html\"\u003Ehe says\u003C\/a\u003E the company may be the &amp;#8220;Red Bull&amp;#8221; of this marketplace, a company that could &amp;#8220;hit an industry from the side with something different, something fresh, and something unexpected.&amp;#8221;\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cb\u003EA team of rivals\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/h2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJolla&amp;#8217;s leadership is well aware of how hard it is to break into a field of entrenched behemoths. One of its solutions is an &amp;#8220;interpretation layer&amp;#8221; that allows Jolla phones to run most Android apps. But for a lot of people to start using Jolla phones, even in a country like China where many are not yet attached to a particular platform, Sailfish is going to need its own apps, and people to build them, as Constantinou points out.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe company has tried hard to create a culture that will attract such people. Because it&amp;#8217;s run by software developers, it\u00a0espouses values\u2014like sharing, collaboration and transparency\u2014beloved by developers, who it hopes will contribute code for free in their spare time, as typically happens with open-source projects. Android, also open-source, has captured some of that goodwill, but the only company allowed to contribute code to Android is Google itself. Google has also been using \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.digitaltrends.com\/mobile\/google-and-alibaba-spar-over-acers-aliyun-phone\/\"\u003Eheavy-handed tactics\u003C\/a\u003E to keep Android handset manufacturers in line.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJolla also comes from a country that is now legendary for its programming prowess. Home of Rovio, maker of Angry Birds, the\u00a0\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/2012-11-22\/-angry-birds-fuels-finland-game-boom-as-investors-seek-next-hit.html\"\u003Emost-downloaded paid game on iTunes ever\u003C\/a\u003E, and Supercell, one of the\u00a0\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/pandodaily.com\/2012\/11\/27\/supercell-is-accels-fastest-growing-company-ever-and-it-has-a-ball-pit\/\"\u003Efastest growing game studios ever\u003C\/a\u003E, Finland is a good place to be popular with programmers. &amp;#8220;Finland is a country of five million people and it sure feels like we have five million supporters here,&amp;#8221; says Dillon.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJolla itself has grown from a staff of \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.zdnet.com\/jollas-meego-ui-is-ready-to-go-and-its-on-the-hunt-for-mobile-talent-7000002728\/\"\u003Earound 50\u003C\/a\u003E in August, expecting to reach 100 by the end of 2012. Many of them will be located in Hong Kong, which will be the headquarters of the Sailfish Alliance.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EOpen to modification\u003C\/h2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe alliance symbolizes another key thing that Jolla says will make it different: the company aims to have less control over Sailfish than any other OS maker has over its OS.\u00a0The purpose of the alliance\u2014which\u00a0includes Tencent, one of China&amp;#8217;s leading online companies, and ST-Ericsson, maker of the chips that already power at least a dozen different Android smartphones\u2014is to make it possible for the various handset makers, software companies and mobile carriers who have a stake in the success of Sailfish to\u00a0dig into the guts of the OS, make suggestions, tweak it for local markets, and put in new services that can help them generate revenue.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, for example, if a company like Samsung offers an Android handset, it has to obey by rules laid down by Google so that it can include the Android app store, called Google Play, on its devices. It can&amp;#8217;t use another app store. Revenue from Google Play goes to Google, not Samsung. By contrast, if a carrier wants to include, for example, its own app store or music service in Sailfish, that&amp;#8217;s no problem.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDillon says that even though Sailfish will always be open-source, Jolla will make money by licensing the patents the company has on its unusual user interface. He also hints at other, more radical business models that revolve around, for example, making it easier to match users with apps, but he says he can&amp;#8217;t yet discuss them.\u00a0&amp;#8221;I don&amp;#8217;t want to go head-to-head with the two big app stores,&amp;#8221; says Dillon. &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;d like to do something a bit different.&amp;#8221;\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EFreedom from the patent wars\u003C\/h2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJolla&amp;#8217;s final advantage is that it believes it can stay out of what has become a massively expensive conflict between phone-makers over intellectual property. Hardly a day goes by that some holder of mobile patents doesn&amp;#8217;t initiate a lawsuit against another\u2014the latest is Nokia versus RIM, maker of the Blackberry, and in August a US court awarded Apple $1 billion in damages in its patent infringement suit against Samsung. &amp;#8220;There were massive investments from previous customers [Intel and Nokia] to clear MeeGo [now Sailfish] from intellectual property issues,&amp;#8221; says Jussi Hurmola, former CEO of Jolla and now a consultant to the company.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis also means that Jolla offers a sweetener to carriers. Because its interface is so different and the OS was written specifically to avoid infringing existing patents, it could be free of the de-facto licensing fees that usually come with using Android on a phone. (As a result, while Google charges nothing for Android, \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/arstechnica.com\/information-technology\/2011\/10\/microsoft-collects-license-fees-on-50-of-android-devices-tells-google-to-wake-up\/\"\u003EMicrosoft is the one that makes money\u003C\/a\u003E every time an Android-powered handset is sold.)\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cb\u003EThe Steve moment\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/h2\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&amp;#8220;Many people have told us that this is not possible\u2026 that the market is flooded,&amp;#8221; Jolla VP Pienim\u00e4ki said at the Sailfish launch. To argue for why the company should succeed he pointed to Jolla&amp;#8217;s deal with D.Phone, but also to the research the company has done on Chinese consumers. &amp;#8220;We spent hundreds of hours studying the marketplace and consumer behavior in the field, in shops, malls, streets; seeing consumer behavior in the metro, subways, bars. [\u2026] That&amp;#8217;s the key power of this company\u2014the management is in the field all the time. You can&amp;#8217;t outsource this kind of market insight.&amp;#8221;\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a Steve-Jobs-like quality to the pride Dillon and Hurmolla take in their creation and their exacting standards for ease of use. I ask Dillon if he would compare his company to Apple.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s fair enough,&amp;#8221; says Dillon. &amp;#8220;We inherited some things from MeeGo, and\u00a0 and some of this has evolved into things have become a bit more revolutionary. We&amp;#8217;ve really simplified the interaction, and made a lot of things easier to use so they require far less interaction. [\u2026] I would like for this to be a major disruption.&amp;#8221;\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut acting like Steve Jobs and succeeding like Steve Jobs are two very different things. Jolla will unveil its first handsets, and its super-secret alternative business models, around the beginning of 2013, says Dillon, and phones running Jolla should be available by the spring. Even if Jolla ultimately succeeds in China or manages to become the &amp;#8220;Red Bull&amp;#8221; of the smartphone world, that will be just the beginning of a very long battle.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cdiv id=\"jp-post-flair\" class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E","featuredImage":{"id":32968,"alt":"","caption":"His team is building &amp;quot;a movement,&amp;quot; and not just a mobile OS, says Mark Dillon, CEO and co-founder of Jolla","credit":"Aaltoes \/ Peter Forsgard","sizes":{"small_30":{"url":"http:\/\/qzprod.files.wordpress.com\/2012\/11\/jolla.jpg?w=320","width":320,"height":180},"medium_20":{"url":"http:\/\/qzprod.files.wordpress.com\/2012\/11\/jolla.jpg?w=700","width":700,"height":393},"medium_40":{"url":"http:\/\/qzprod.files.wordpress.com\/2012\/11\/jolla.jpg?w=880","width":880,"height":495}}},"topPostsRank":1,"taxonomies":{"kicker":[{"name":"Sailfish","slug":"sailfish"}],"obsession":[{"name":"Mobile Web","slug":"mobile-web"}],"tags":[{"name":"Android","slug":"android"},{"name":"Apple","slug":"apple"},{"name":"Google","slug":"google"},{"name":"iOS","slug":"ios"},{"name":"iPhone","slug":"iphone"},{"name":"Jolla","slug":"jolla"},{"name":"mobile","slug":"mobile"},{"name":"Sailfish","slug":"sailfish"},{"name":"Samsung","slug":"samsung"},{"name":"smartphones","slug":"smartphones"},{"name":"Technology","slug":"technology"}]},"byline":{"authors":[{"name":"Christopher Mims","username":"mimsquartz","url":"http:\/\/qz.com\/author\/mimsquartz\/"}]}}]};
