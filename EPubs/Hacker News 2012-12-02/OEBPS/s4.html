The product lens
There has been a lot of discussion lately about the markets for startup financing. Many of the discussions use words like “valuations” “bubble” “crunch” etc. Words like that generally mean the writer is discussing the world through the lens of finance. This is a useful lens, but I&amp;#8217;d like to suggest there is another lens that is also useful: the product lens. First, some background.
Two markets
Startups sit in the middle of two markets: one between VCs and startups, and one between startups and customers. These markets are correlated but only partially. When the financing supply is low but customer demand is high, entrepreneurs that are able to finagle funding generally do well. When financing and startup supply is high, customers do well, some startups do well, and VCs generally don’t. And so on.
When VCs get too excited, people talk about a bubble. When VCs get too fearful, people talk about a crash. Historically, downturns were great times for startups that were able to raise money because competition was low but customer demand for new technology remained fairly steady. Downturns also tended to coincide with big platform shifts, which usually meant opportunities for entrepreneurs.
These markets shift independently between different stages and sectors, although there are connections. The amount of financing available is relatively constant, because of the longevity of VC funds and the way most VCs are compensated (management fees). Less financing in one sector or stage usually leads to more financing in others.
The stages are related because the early stages depend on the later stages for exits and financings. The result is a bullwhip effect where changes in later stages (the latest stage being public markets) lead to magnified changes in early stages.
Smart VCs understand these dynamics and adjust their strategies accordingly. Smart entrepreneurs don’t need to think about these things very often. Fundraising is necessary (at least for companies that choose to go the VC route &amp;#8211; many shouldn’t), but just one of the many things an entrepreneur needs to do. The best advice is simply to raise money when you can, and try to weather the vicissitudes of the financial markets.
The product lens
Good entrepreneurs spend most of their time focusing on the other market: the one between their company and their customers. This means looking at the world through the lens of products and not financing. This lens is particularly important when you are initially developing your idea or when you are thinking about product expansions.
The product lens suggests you should ask questions like: have the products in area X caught up to the best practices of the industry? Are they reaching their potential? Are they exciting? Are there big cultural/technological/economic changes happening that allow dramatically better products to be created? Sometimes the product lens guides you to the same conclusion as the finance lens and sometimes it doesn&amp;#8217;t.
For example, there has been a lot of hand wringing about a financing crunch for consumer internet startups. One theme is that investors are pivoting from consumer to enterprise. The finance lens says: for the last five years or so, consumer was overfunded and enterprise was underfunded &amp;#8211; let&amp;#8217;s correct this. It also helps that enterprise IPOs have performed much better than consumer IPOs in the last year or so.
The product lens is tricky. My sense is that, at least for the non-mobile consumer internet, the product lens and financing lens agree. Anyone who has had the misfortune to use enterprise technology lately will tell you that the hardware and software they use at home (iPhone, Gmail, etc) is far and away more sophisticated and elegant than the software they use at work. It feels like the enterprise tech is way behind in the product upgrade cycle.
Mobile seems like a case where the lenses disagree. The finance lens says: billions of dollars have been invested in mobile apps. It has become hit driven and there have been very few “venture-scale” startups created.
The product lens says: the modern smartphone platform began about four years ago when the iOS app store launched. This is clearly a major new platform. Platforms and apps interact in a push-pull relationship that takes decades to play out. Innovative new apps, designs and technologies are created all the time. It would be surprising &amp;#8211; and contrary to all the historical patterns &amp;#8211; if the mobile product evolution were already played out.
That is not to dismiss the finance lens. It could be painful along the way:  financing markets might dry up, and profits might accrue to the platforms over the apps. But clearly mobile is just getting started.
Some of the biggest mistakes I’ve made as an angel investor stemmed from being beholden to the finance lens. The finance lens feels more scientific and therefore appeals to analytical types. It might sound unsophisticated to say “the products for X are crappy, and I have an idea for how to make them great.” But in many cases, it&amp;#8217;s actually that simple.

Even within consumer internet, mobile still seems to be the most important trend.
The mobile experience for almost all the consumer internet  businesses that we know is terrible.  Take search or blogging on mobile for examples.
So from the product lens, it stills seems to be a time of great opportunity for entrepreneurs who can scrape together funding if it&amp;#8217;s necessary.
Obvious question is now as a VC &amp;#8212; instead of an angel or entrepreneur &amp;#8212; how are you going to handle the situations where the financing and product lens contradict each other?
http://www.cdixon.org/                chris dixon
Good question. I&amp;#8217;d try err on the side of the product perspective. But it is hard when you aren&amp;#8217;t spending all your time building products.

Nice post Chris. Wouldn&amp;#8217;t your post further support the idea about patient capital. In other words, good investors should support the entrepreneur long term vision and the two lenses will have moments where they merge. Or am I being too idealistic!
http://www.cdixon.org/                chris dixon
I totally agree. One of the great things about VC (vs other forms of financing) is it&amp;#8217;s long term nature (10 years +)

I simply call it &amp;#8220;sticking with what you know&amp;#8221;. If you chase markets, by whatever lens you use, chances are you are going to have a rough ride. I have seen this in the trading world, as well as in the tech investing world.
http://www.cdixon.org/                chris dixon
Agree. But you can also actively decide what to learn more about and then stick with that.

strongly agree on the ability to focus your learning.  I re-build my Google reader list about once a year with a new focus area each time.

The products for audio are crappy, and I have an idea for how to make them great. http://tinyvox.com (this was a rad piece @cdixon thanks !)

Hey Chris, curious what you think about the alignment of the product/finance lenses when it comes to eCommerce (not necessarily just on mobile).
http://www.cdixon.org/                chris dixon
I am still trying to figure out ecommerce. I blogged about it a while ago if you are interested. http://cdixon.org/2012/08/15/e-commerce-startups/
http://www.facebook.com/jamiequint                Jamie Quint
Yep, saw that, thanks. Great comments on that post.

Chris &amp;#8211; any intuition as to whether the product and finance lenses are starting to converge for hardware / &amp;#8216;software in plastic&amp;#8217; oriented startups?
(PS. nice post, thanks)
http://www.cdixon.org/                chris dixon
Consumer hardware? Seems like an interesting emerging area that VCs are starting to get interested in.

Maybe it&amp;#8217;s even simpler. &amp;#8220;I really want to build X. In fact, I have to build X.&amp;#8221; Even less sophisticated, but isn&amp;#8217;t that really where the best companies come from? Maybe the products for X aren&amp;#8217;t even completely crappy. Maybe they&amp;#8217;re just not as great as you know they can be. As you know they have to be.
I believe what you wrote a while back about studying philosophy. If you can imagine yourself doing something else, you should do something else.
I guess I&amp;#8217;m suggesting a variant of the product lens, with a really personal view that&amp;#8217;s even harder to quantify. Do what you have to do. Understand the prevailing consensus views/lenses because you&amp;#8217;ll need to adjust your tactics to deal with them. But that&amp;#8217;s it. Damn the torpedoes and damn the lenses.
http://www.cdixon.org/                chris dixon
Totally agree. Usually &amp;#8220;I have to build X&amp;#8221; is the best indicator that the product needs to exist. Reminds me of PG&amp;#8217;s notion of a &amp;#8220;organic startup ideas&amp;#8221; (which I loved).
http://www.justfamily.com/                Nate Quigley
Oh right, just like that organic ideas post. And the best ideas will &amp;#8220;force themselves&amp;#8221; on founders living out in the future in some area.

When you mention that some of the biggest mistakes you&amp;#8217;ve made have stemmed from being beholden to the finance lens, are you referring more to opportunities you&amp;#8217;ve regrettably passed on or investments you&amp;#8217;ve made?
johnr
Interesting, I would have argued that your angel investing with a finance lens is actually a strength and that most active angels invest with a product lens.
http://www.cdixon.org/                chris dixon
Well, I think you have to balance them.
johnr
Absolutely.  I think a lot of angels out there don&amp;#8217;t have the finance lens and therefore don&amp;#8217;t have the ability to balance.

I agree that sometimes it as simple as &amp;#8220;things suck and people won&amp;#8217;t put up with this forever&amp;#8221;.
This part confused me a bit though:  &amp;#8220;Platforms and apps interact in a push-pull relationship that takes decades to play out.&amp;#8221;
How does the app store being 4 years old mean we know the push-pull relationship between the app store and apps will take decades to play out? I believe that you believe it, but it doesn&amp;#8217;t feel as obvious to me as it seems to you.  Is your belief based on other platforms and their applications that you&amp;#8217;ve seen evolve over time?  If so, do you have some examples?  The push-pull aspect you refer to isn&amp;#8217;t obvious to me either. It seems the pace of innovation is accelerating &amp;#8211; especially in the mobile space. Behavior change is tough, but I&amp;#8217;d say 10 years is the new 20 years &amp;#8211; at the maximum.

I&amp;#8217;ve got a theory that consumer facing entreprise startups (particularly for mobile) will be HUGE in the next 5 years.
The idea is startups that help individuals do their jobs better but, when used collaboratively, make businesses run MUCH better. An app that makes sales people better sales people so sales PEOPLE download and use it, but the monetization is on connecting the CRM and the rest of the team to the system, for instance.
Helps with the complexities of entreprise distribution with freemium, consumer-like distribution without the consumer-monetization or &amp;#8220;is this solving a core problem&amp;#8221; problem.
I think investors AND customers will love this kind of startup, and I think Github is kind of the model for it. We&amp;#8217;ll see.
