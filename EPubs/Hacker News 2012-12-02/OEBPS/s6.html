We're doing a survey to assess how different companies hire (e.g., success rate per applicant, processes used, types of candidates hired etc). We hope the results of this survey will help companies figure out how they compare (e.g, perhaps you're getting way more/less applicants than the average start-up). Please fill this out and we'll publish the results. Would really appreciate your help!http://hireartsurvey.wufoo.com/forms/please-tell-us-how-you-hire/

This is a pretty bad survey. It asks if I have hired any non-technical people or technical people, then 100% of the deeper questions are about non-technical hires.  Yet, there was no way to enter "n/a" for MOST of those questions, so instead, I polluted your data, unfortunately.(I have zero desire to hire non-technical hires for as long as possible.  I pray I can put that off for well over another year.  Even sales can be replaced with Sales Engineer or Sales Analyst, Palantir-style.  We outsource the useless non-differentiated parts of the business -- hr, accounting, compliance.)replymrtron 9 minutes ago  | link
Very interesting hiring approach.  The space has seemed ripe for innovation for years and years.Highly motivated job seekers willing to jump through a lot of hoops seem to be on the bottom side of talent.  How do you solve this issue?replypixeloution 11 minutes ago  | link
This is a very poorly written survey; you post on Hacker News and you make it very difficult for someone who does 100% technical hires (not unusual for this board) to fill out your survey. I just left one abandoned.If you're looking for information on non-technical position hiring, this is probably not the place to gather it.replyrdl 7 minutes ago  | link
Founders often do have to hire non-tech people.  The first non-tech hires are some of the most difficult for tech founders.  HN is a pretty decent place to find technical founders of companies.It's just a badly written survey, not a bad idea to post the survey.  They should fix the survey and re-ask, or just make it entirely and explicitly about "hiring early non-technical hires", which is what I think they care about.replynsedlet 39 minutes ago  | link
