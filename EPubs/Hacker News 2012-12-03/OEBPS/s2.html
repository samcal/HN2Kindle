Apple - Think Different
Twice.
I'm writing this because I think Apple may have changed. I have been a
loyal customer for 11 years, but will think twice before every buying from them
again. I hope anyone reading this will do the same.
I bought from Apple because they make (made) fantastic products that are
a joy to use, and if they went wrong they would look after you. But I, like
many others, have recently been on the wrong side of Apple and been left
regretting swapping my cash for their shiny-new-thing.
As an illustration of the ghosting on my $4k machine, here’s a pic of my
screen trying to show a plain grey screen after a photo of Phil Schiller (left), Tim Cook (centre), and Jonathan Ive (right) had been on it for 3 mins.
I'm not pretending my case is unique / new / particularly note-worthy. I
just want to put it out there.
I bought a retina-MBP, it had serious and annoying ghosting (a common
problem). I asked apple to repair it (I have Apple care), they administered a&amp;nbsp;spurious&amp;nbsp;test (my opinion, see results below), said it was within their tolerances
and refused. I, rather disappointed, complained at every possible level to no
avail.
This is a real problem with my laptop that affects my use of the device
every day. I am now having to pay myself to have the screen 'replaced' - not
'repaired' as Apple's representatives are keen to point out.
My opinion is that Apple have created a spurious test to get out of an
expensive repair that affects a large number of devices. Worse, they have
continued to ignore a customers genuine issue.
All this has left me disillusioned with Apple. Would I have spent $3k -
including Apple Care! - with them knowing I would be this unsupported - having
to spend £500 to repair replace my own faulty screen?. No.
Part of buying from Apple is knowing that you'll be looked after. I
wasn't for the first time in 11 years, and I and others&amp;nbsp;get the feeling
that it is because Apple itself is changing.
The point of me writing this up &amp;amp;
sharing is to encourage people to think twice before buying an Apple product -
They still make amazing products, but they may not be the dependable company
that their brand represents. It may no longer make sense for some people to
trust that they'll be looked after by them.
I purchased a few months ago a Retina MacBook Pro. When it arrived, I
was happy and smug, as only an Apple-geek with the shiniest kit in town can be.
However, through day-to-day use I noticed strange lines appearing on the
screen. First, when the unlock-screen presented itself, it seems to have a
slight transparency to the desktop.
Once I noticed it, it seemed to get worse, though this might be because
I knew about it &amp;amp; saw it more often, or because it did actually get worse.
Either way I was getting less and less happy with my new shiny thing. I would
work on a document, flick to working on some photos &amp;amp; there would be
not-so-mysterious lines appear 'over' the images.
It wasn't long before I did some searches and found out that this was in
fact something known as ghosting - a problem occurring with some of the
retina MBPs.
I purchased the r-MBP because it was powerful enough to cope with my
needs &amp;amp; had a fantastic screen. The screen now, was no longer fantastic. So,
still smug, as I purchased apple care, I booked an appointment with a genius
and prepared myself to be looked after.
I cannot remember the last time a saw a genius, not because I haven't seen
one recently, but because it’s always been a pleasurable experience that falls
back into the mists of past 'Apple is a great company' positive thoughts.
This time it was not. I left disillusioned with apple and an extremely
unhappy customer.
I'll try to be brief on boring detail. But Apple’s decision about
whether my screen was faulty hinged on a test. &amp;amp; despite the fact that I
could repeat the issue, my laptop passed the test &amp;amp; no further help was
offered…
(please note this is my representation of the test, not the actual test)
Apple’s test puts up a full-screen B&amp;amp;W grid for 3 minutes:
(whilst you try to contain your excitement)
Followed by a grey one for one minute:
…an exiting un-apple shade
Then you look for any residual patterns. If you see any residual
patterns, the display is at fault. If there are none, you are.
…That my rMBP somehow passed…
When my r-MBP took the test in-store, there were no visible residual
images.&amp;nbsp; I was stunned.
In my every-day use, I get ghost images all the time - it happens
whenever I use the computer. Its a visual reminder that I spent thousands of
pounds on a lemon!
Now Apple turns round, ‘showing’
that the problem I have doesn't exist. That, and my 15 mins is almost up, so I
have to wait to discuss further, or go away and call Apple Care.
I was put in the position where I had to justify something that I knew
was an issue, that Apple said wasn't. As a customer, I was far from happy. This
is not a position I have ever been with Apple, and was not pleasant.
To give you an idea - I've now spent about 15 minutes writing this. I've
just taken a photo of a plain grey window on my computer &amp;amp; you can just
about read the text that I've written so far. But, according to apple's test
this is not an issue, or rather 'within their tolerances'.
This is a plain grey window (+ cursor). According Apple &amp;amp; my retina
display
Well, its not within my tolerance - or even reasonable expectation of
how i'd expect a device sold on its screen to be - &amp;amp; I'd really like a
company like Apple not to have tolerances set so disappointingly low, or to
admit when they’re wrong.
So I got home &amp;amp; did some tests on Apple’s test. What I found was
quite interesting:
1. White on Black doesn't seem to generate the strongest ghosting effect
- White on Dark-grey does
2. Your ability to see the ghosting depends on the shade of the grey
screen you use afterwards
3. Over the course of the one minute you are meant to leave it, an
extremely strong effect can almost disappear.
You might think this last point is irrelevant, but hang on, If you work
on one thing, then switch to another (e.g. an image) are you then to wait
one-minute until the screen catches up with you to carry on? “perfect clarity”
indeed.
Anyway. I developed a quick test of my own - keeping with the same
timings, but changing the following:
&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;.I use different shades
of grey (&amp;lt;50) instead of black chequered pattern.
2. I used a darkish grey screen to view effects afterwards
3. I took photos (with the iPhone 4 I have to hand) before and after the
one minute leaving period.
After 3 minutes of the test screen the results were clear:
Don’t worry, Apple says this isn’t relevant.
After 1 minute they were very faint, but still present (please ignore my
silhouette):
Again, don’t worry, Apple says you don’t care
The problem with Apple’s
test:
After two small tweaks, EITHER: Grey-on-white, OR, a different shaded
test-screen – Apple’s test has an utterly different result.
The test is right-on-the edge of detecting my displays issue, and Apple has
failed to deal with or detect the real
customer issue. A customer that has by this point, spent a lot of money
with Apple.
I can only imagine that this has happened either through incompetence
(poor test design), or by Apple constructing a deliberately self-serving test
to deal with an otherwise expensive repair. Either way I’d been fobbed off.
But my problem isn’t Apple’s
test:
My experience as a whole was extremely negative, and I don’t remember it
being like that. I remember an Apple that bent over backwards to understand its
customers’ point of view and stretched itself to meet the high expectations it
sets.
Having written to them about my test (a past version of this blog post),
they got in contact to repeat their stance: The test was passed, it didn’t
matter what I stated the issue was, or what I could demonstrate. Line in the
sand. No leeway.
My view of Apple has changed. As a loyal customer of apple for almost 11
years (iMac G4) my loyalty has been shaken.
Even the Apple store, a relatively new invention of my time with Apple
has changed. I’ve been in with the most absurd of problems, and been treated to
nothing but patience, flexibility and generosity from Apple. This seems to have been superseded by a “Computer
says no” style, where I get told that I have to call Apple myself to take
things further.
Is Apple still a great company that works to provide amazing products
and user experience to its customers? Or is it just my memory ghosting?
I don’t pretend to know what Apple should be doing. It’s a fantastically
innovative company seeking profits in an intensely competitive environment. But
at the very least it needs to do two things:
·&amp;nbsp; Change the test – it is either dishonest or just not
fair to customers
·&amp;nbsp; Don’t try to fob customers off – it goes against
everything Apple stood for
